      "Summary: The United Arab Emirates (UAE), or simply the Emirates, is a country in West Asia, in the Middle East, at the eastern end of the Arabian Peninsula. It is a federal elective monarchy made up of seven emirates, with Abu Dhabi serving as its capital. It shares land borders with Oman to the east and northeast, and with Saudi Arabia to the southwest; as well as maritime borders in the Persian Gulf with Qatar and Iran, and with Oman in the Gulf of Oman. As of 2024, the UAE has an estimated population of over 10 million, of which 11% are Emiratis; Dubai is its most populous city and is an international hub. Islam is the official religion and Arabic is the official language, while English is the most spoken language and the language of business.\n",
      "The United Arab Emirates oil and natural gas reserves are the world's seventh and seventh-largest, respectively. Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, ruler of Abu Dhabi and the country's first president, oversaw the development of the Emirates by investing oil revenues into healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The country has the most diversified economy among the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). In the 21st century, the UAE has become less reliant on oil and gas and is economically focusing on tourism and business. The UAE is considered a middle power. It is also a member of the United Nations, Arab League, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, OPEC, Non-Aligned Movement, World Trade Organization, and BRICS.  The UAE is also a dialogue partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.\n",
      "Human rights organisations consider the UAE substandard on human rights, ranking only 6.06 in the human freedom index, citing reports of government critics being imprisoned and tortured, families harassed by the state security apparatus, and cases of forced disappearances. Individual rights such as the freedoms of assembly, association, expression, and the freedom of the press are severely repressed.\n",

The city is the seat of the Abu Dhabi Central Capital District, the capital city of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, and the UAE's second-most populous city, after Dubai. The city is situated on a T-shaped island, extending into the Persian Gulf from the central-western coast of the UAE.\n",
      "Abu Dhabi is located on an island in the Persian Gulf, off the Central West Coast. Most of the city and the Emirate reside on the mainland connected to the rest of the country. As of 2023, Abu Dhabi's urban area had an estimated population of 2.5 million, out of 3.8 million in the emirate of Abu Dhabi. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority is headquartered in the city, and was the world's 3rd largest sovereign wealth fund in 2022. Abu Dhabi itself has over a trillion US dollars worth of assets under management in a combination of various sovereign wealth funds headquartered there.\n",
      "Abu Dhabi houses local and federal government offices and is the home of the United Arab Emirates Government and the Supreme Council for Financial and Economic Affairs. The city is home to the UAE's president, a member of the Al Nahyan family. Abu Dhabi's rapid development and urbanisation, coupled with the massive oil and gas reserves and production and relatively high average income, have transformed it into a large, developed metropolis. It is the country's centre of politics and industry, and a major culture and commerce center. Abu Dhabi accounts for about two-thirds of the roughly $503 billion UAE economy.\n"

      "Copyright Information: © 2025. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.\n",
      "Summary::\n",
      "BACKGROUND: The tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in cancer progression, with tumor-associated macrophages regulating immune responses. These macrophages can adopt a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype that suppresses tumor growth or an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype that promotes progression. Reprogramming macrophages toward the M1 phenotype is a therapeutic strategy. Previous studies showed that 4-Fluorophenylacetamide-acetyl coumarin (4-FPAC), a synthetic coumarin derivative, exhibits cytostatic activity in A549 lung carcinoma cells by modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide synthase, and signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT/NF-κB. This study evaluates the impact of 4-FPAC on macrophage polarization.\n",
      "HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that 4-FPAC promotes M1 macrophage polarization while suppressing M2 markers through modulation of signaling pathways, thus serving as an immunomodulatory agent.\n",
      "RESULTS: Treatment with 4-FPAC induced M1 polarization in THP1-derived macrophages, evident from morphological elongation, elevated ROS and NO production, and increased IL-12 levels. IL-10 levels and M2 markers (CD163, STAT3, AKT1) were downregulated, while M1 markers (CD80, STAT1, AKT2) were upregulated. Gene expression and western blot analyses revealed activation of P38 and NF-κB pathways and reduced phosphorylated AKT1 levels. In silico docking showed strong interactions of 4-FPAC with regulatory proteins like P38, NF-κB, and AKT1, suggesting pathway modulation.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: 4-FPAC facilitates M1 macrophage polarization and inhibits M2 signaling, demonstrating its potential as an immunomodulatory agent. Coupled with its cytostatic effects on A549 cells\n"

All rights reserved.\\nSummary::\\nMelanoma is one of the most common cancers worldwide with a high mortality rate. However, the smaller the melanoma is when it is first diagnosed, the better the prognosis. Since skin melanomas can be detected relatively easy with the naked eye, systematic skin cancer screening could theoretically reduce melanoma mortality by diagnosing it as early as possible. Evaluations of skin cancer early detection programs show an increase in the incidence of detection of the skin cancer and especially thins melanomas, but so far, no evidence of a decrease in mortality. Current data on patient-related factors show that fewer men and people with lower socioeconomic status participate in skin cancer screening and knowledge about skin cancer-associated factors is low.Based on the current study situation, it is therefore not possible to recommend or advise against skin cancer screening for the asymptomatic population. Screening is recommended for all people at increased risk: fair skin type according to Fitzpatrick I-II, under immunosuppression, more than 50 melanocytic nevi and history of dysplastic and/or large nevi, family history of melanoma, frequent severe sunburns in childhood. In addition, targeted educational campaigns among risk groups (men, people with low levels of education) are needed.New imaging techniques such as 3D whole-body photography with additional computer-based, AI-assisted risk assessment of digital dermoscopic images, when integrated into clinical decision-making processes (as \"augmented intelligence\" - AI), clearly have the potential to improve skin cancer screening, particularly in high-risk and melanoma patients. In combination with human expertise, they can potentially offer a more effective and comprehensive approach to detecting and monitoring skin cancer.
