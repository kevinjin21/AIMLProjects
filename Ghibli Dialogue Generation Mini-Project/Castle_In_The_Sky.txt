 MEN
 Ah!!

 CREWMAN
 Wah! It's a gas bomb!! It's an attack!!

 MEN
 Wah!!

 Voices
 Ah! Wah! Hey!!

 MOOSKA
 Hold them there.
 You, get down on the floor!!

 DARK GLASSES
 Tear gas!

 DORA'S VOICE
 What's the delay?

 SHEETA
 Ah!!

 DORA'S VOICE
 Can't you break in at once ?!

 LOUIE
 She's here!!
 Mama, she's here!!
 She was hiding!!

 DORA
 Hurry up and catch her!!

 LOUIE
 Mama, I'll fall!!

 DORA
 That's it -- the stone!!
 Hurry -- into the next room!!
 It's a Levistone!

 SHEETA
 Ah!!

 WOMAN
 Scream!

 SHEETA
 (Falling)
 Ah!!

 DORA
 Damn -- the Levistone. . .
 Title: Laputa -- The Castle in the Sky

 PAZU
 Uncle -- put in two meatballs.

 SHOP OWNER
 Working a lot of overtime?

 PAZU
 Business may be finally picking up again.

 WOMAN
 Still working?!

 PAZU
 Yes.

 PAZU
 What's that?

 PAZU
 It's a person!!

 PAZU
 Wah!!

 BOSS
 PAZU!!

 BOSS
 What are you doing up there?
 What about dinner?

 PAZU
 Boss!!
 A -- a girl from the sky!!

 BOSS
 Shit!
 Ouch. . .

 PAZU
 Boss -- a girl from the sky. . .

 BOSS
 Shit -- worn-out engines!!

 PAZU
 Boss -- a girl from the sky!!

 BOSS
 Close the #2 valve!!

 BOSS
 Ouch. . .
 Pazu, hand me a wrench.

 PAZU
 Yes, sir.

 BOSS
 I can't let go!!
 You do it!!

 PAZU
 Huh?

 BOSS
 Don't keep the people down below waiting.

 PAZU
 Yes, sir!

 BOSS
 Just keep calm.

 PAZU
 Yes, sir.

 BOSS
 Brake!!

 PAZU
 Yes, sir!!
 Phew. . .

 ASSAYIST
 How was it?

 MINER
 It's no use.
 The silver isn't concentrated anywhere.

 ASSAYIST
 Just digging is useless. . .
 Shouldn't you have dug to the east?

 MINER
 There's only old shafts over there.

 MINER
 We'll just have to do it over again, won't we?

 ASSAYIST
 Yes. . .
 Over again. . .

 MINER
 That's it. . .

 BOSS
 Put out the boiler fire.
 No overtime tonight.
 These are hard times -- we'll end up starving.

 BOSS
 Pazu -- oil that run-down engine.

 PAZU
 Yes, Sir.

 CHARLES
 It's no use, Mama.
 We can't find anything in the dark.

 DORA
 You think we've searched thoroughly, eh?!

 DORA
 There's no evidence . . .
 We'll start afresh when it gets light.

 SHEETA
 Ah!!

 PAZU
 Ha, ha, ha. . .
 Well, how do you feel?
 Wah!
 Hey, wait!!
 Wait, I said!!

 PAZU
 I'm Pazu.
 I live alone in this hut.
 When I'm done playing, I give them this.

 SHEETA
 Ha, ha, ha!

 PAZU
 Heh, I'm relieved.

 PAZU
 At any rate, you look human.
 Until a little while ago, I was worried
 you were an angel or something.

 SHEETA
 Thanks for saving me.
 I'm Sheeta.

 PAZU
 Sheeta -- that's a nice name.
 I was surprised, the way you fell out of the sky.

 SHEETA
 I see. . .
 Why do you suppose I was saved. . .?
 After all, I fell out of an airship. . .

 PAZU
 Don't you remember?

 SHEETA
 No. . .

 PAZU
 Hm. . .

 PAZU
 Say, can I borrow that for a minute?

 SHEETA
 This?

 PAZU
 Yes.

 SHEETA
 It's been in my family for generations. . .

 PAZU
 A pretty stone, isn't it. . .
 Just a second. . .
 Hm. Ha, ha, ha!
 Watch!!

 SHEETA
 Pazu!!

 PAZU
 Looks like it wasn't this stone after all, eh. . .?
 Wah!

 SHEETA
 Pazu -- ah!!
 Pazu -- hang on. . .

 SHEETA
 Are you OK?

 PAZU
 Yes -- and you?

 SHEETA
 Fine.
 Does it hurt?

 PAZU
 Yes.
 My head hurts from Boss's fist.

 SHEETA
 Ha, ha, ha. . .

 PAZU
 Oh, yeah -- the pot has boiled over.
 Let's go in and eat!!

 PAZU
 You can wash your face over there.
 There are towels, too.

 SHEETA
 Thanks!!

 SHEETA
 Laputa. . .

 PAZU
 Sheeta!!
 Sheeta, ready yet. . .?
 That's a photograph Father took from an airship.

 PAZU
 ``Laputa'' is an island floating in the sky.''

 SHEETA
 An island that floats in the sky?

 PAZU
 Yes.
 And although it's said to be a legend. . .
 My father saw it!!

 PAZU
 It's the photograph he took then.
 Although Swift wrote about Laputa in ``Gulliver's Travels'',''
 that was just a story.
 Father drew this from his imagination!

 PAZU
 There's no one living there any more.
 But supposedly there's a lot of treasure there.
 But nobody believed it.
 Father died in Sagi, working on it.

 PAZU
 But, my father's not a liar.
 And one day I'll prove it!
 I'll discover Laputa. . .
 Hm?

 PAZU
 An automobile -- how rare!!

 SHEETA
 They're pirates.

 PAZU
 Eh?!

 SHEETA
 They're the ones who attacked the airship!!

 PAZU
 They're after you?

 SHEETA
 Yes.

 PAZU
 Hurry -- this way!!

 PAZU
 Good morning!!

 LOUIE
 Hey!! Wait!!

 PAZU
 What?
 I'm in a hurry!!

 LOUIE
 Has a new girl come to these parts?

 PAZU
 She came yesterday, to Boss's place -- baby Madge!!

 LOUIE
 Shit!!
 A coincidence!!

 PAZU
 Bye!!

 PAZU
 They are after you. . .

 MAN
 Louie -- a girl's dress!!

 LOUIE
 What?!
 Disguised?!
 You tell Mama!!

 MAN
 Right!

 BOSS
 Haven't seen her. . .

 CHARLES
 A pretty girl, with dark hair in braids?

 PAZU
 Boss!!
 Boss!!

 CHARLES
 About that age. . .

 SHEETA
 Ah!!

 CHARLES
 Mmm!?

 LOUIE
 Brother!!
 That's her!!

 PAZU
 They're pirates!
 They're after this girl.

 MADGE
 Pirates!
 Look!

 BOSS
 That's far enough.

 CHARLES
 We'll get her.

 BOSS
 Pirates?

 CHARLES
 The Dora Clan.

 BOSS
 Leave us.
 There are only poor people here.

 PAZU
 Wah!!

 PAZU
 Okami!!

 OKAMI
 Escape out the back!!

 PAZU
 I'll fight, too!!

 OKAMI
 They have weapons.

 PAZU
 But. . .

 OKAMI
 Be a good boy, won't you?
 Protect her.

 CHARLES
 In any case, we'll get her somehow.

 BOSS
 Think you're a man?
 Then settle it with fists.

 HENRI
 All right!
 Do it, Brother!

 CROWD
 (Claps)
 OH!!

 MAN
 Oh, my -- show him, Daffy!

 LOUIE
 Amazing. . .

 OKAMI
 Who sewed that shirt?

 CHARLES
 Ooh!!

 MAN
 Don't be beaten!!
 Go!!

 LOUIE AND HENRI
 Brother, don't give up!

 HENRI
 Go!!
 Go!!
 Eh?

 DORA
 They think they can fool me?
 Follow them!!

 PAZU
 Hey!!
 Get on!!

 PAZU
 Good!!

 ENGINEER
 Pazu -- taking the day off?

 PAZU
 We're being chased.

 ENGINEER
 Oh. . .?

 PAZU
 It's the Dora Clan. . .

 ENGINEER
 Pirates?
 Wow!

 PAZU
 Let us ride as far as the next city, and we'll go for the police.

 ENGINEER
 All right.
 Help out as a stoker!!

 PAZU
 Sure.

 LOUIE AND HENRI
 Mama!!

 DORA
 These stupid sons of mine -- hurry up and get in!!

 LOUIE
 Eh. . .?!
 But the girl's over there.

 DORA
 She's sneaked out the back door.
 Don't stop.

 HENRI
 Brother. . .

 MEN
 Wait!!

 ENGINEER
 Pazu -- they're on to you!

 PAZU
 Uncle -- can't this go any faster?

 ENGINEER
 She's pretty old.

 DORA
 Let's change!!

 LOUIE
 Mama -- I'm falling!!

 ENGINEER
 More steam -- they're gaining on us!!

 LOUIE
 Faster!!

 PAZU
 Sheeta -- this way!!

 PAZU
 Take care of the stoking!!

 SHEETA
 Yes.

 DORA
 Don't give up!!

 SHEETA
 Pazu!!

 PAZU
 Shit!!

 DORA
 Push!!
 Keep pushing!!

 DORA
 Wait!!
 They won't get away.
 Don't just sit there -- push these things off the track!

 DORA'S SONS
 Eh??

 ENGINEER
 Ha, ha, ha. . .
 There -- running fine!!

 PAZU
 I'll do it.

 SHEETA
 We'll do it.

 DORA
 Wait!!

 LOUIE
 It's THEM, Mama. . .
 What'll we do. . .?

 DORA
 I'm not giving up just yet!
 We start at once!!

 ENGINEER
 Hey, we're blocked.
 It's the army.

 ENGINEER
 Hey, please help out these kids.
 They're being followed by pirates.

 PAZU
 Sheeta. . .?

 SHEETA
 Bye!

 DARK GLASSES
 Wait!!

 PAZU
 Sheeta!!

 SOLDIER
 Stop!!

 SOLDIER
 Stop or I'll shoot!!

 HENRI
 It's an armored tank!!

 DORA
 I don't care!
 Ram it!!

 PAZU
 Sheeta -- what's the matter?!

 SHEETA
 Don't ask!!

 DORA
 Shit!!

 LOUIE
 They'll fall!!

 DORA
 Be quiet -- watch closely!!

 PAZU
 We're floating!!

 DORA
 See that?
 The power of the Levistone!!

 PAZU
 It WAS the stone after all!
 Amazing!!

 SHEETA
 Ah!!

 PAZU
 It's OK.
 We'll go to the very bottom.

 DORA
 AMAZING!!
 I want it. . .!

 SOLDIER
 Fire!!

 DORA
 Excellent!!
 It WILL be mine!!

 SHEETA
 It's going out. . .

 PAZU
 Ah -- wait. . .

 PAZU
 It did that when you first came floating down, too.
 The entrance looks so small. . .

 SHEETA
 I hope nothing awful happens to your Boss, or the Engineer. . .

 PAZU
 It's OK.
 Miners aren't all that soft.
 Let's go.
 Since long ago, the mountain's been riddled with mine shafts.
 Here.

 SHEETA
 I'm glad -- I'm awfully hungry.

 PAZU
 There's one apple and two sweets for later.

 SHEETA
 Wow. . .

 SHEETA
 Your bag is like magic.
 It contains everything.

 PAZU
 Gondoa . . .?
 That's right in the heart of the northern mountains, isn't it?

 SHEETA
 Yes. . .
 Mother and Father died and left me the house and farm.
 I managed alone, somehow. . .

 PAZU
 You were kidnapped by those men with ``Dark Glasses''?''

 SHEETA
 Yes. . .

 PAZU
 The same men we saw?. . .
 Who could it be. . .
 With such an army. . .
 Both Dora and the Dark Glasses want to get the stone. . .

 SHEETA
 I had no idea there was such a mysterious power in this stone.

 SHEETA
 It's always been in my family since ancient times.
 Mother gave it to me when she died,
 telling me never to give it to strangers,
 or even show it to them.

 PAZU
 Hm.
 Neither one of us has parents.

 SHEETA
 Forgive me, for getting you mixed up in my troubles, Pazu.

 PAZU
 Don't worry.
 When you fell from the sky, my heart was pounding.

 PAZU
 I knew it was the start of something wonderful.

 POM
 Imps . . .
 It's imps. . .

 PAZU
 Grandpa Pom!!
 It's OK.
 He's a very nice man.
 Grandpa Pom -- we're lost!!

 POM
 At last. . .
 Pazu looked just like an imp. . .
 And a little girl imp, too, I see.

 PAZU
 We're being chased by pirates.

 POM
 Oh. . .?

 PAZU
 And by the army, too.

 POM
 Indeed. . .
 Ho, ho. . .
 Well, intrepid, aren't you. . .

 POM
 Well, help yourself.

 SHEETA
 Thanks.
 Grandpa, do you always stay underground?

 POM
 Ho, ho, ho . . .
 Impossible!
 Since last night,
 the stones have been making a mysterious commotion. . .

 POM
 I hope they quiet down soon.

 PAZU
 The rocks make noise . . . ?

 POM
 Ho, ho, ho. . .
 The stones have small voices . . .

 SHEETA
 Wow. . .

 PAZU
 Amazing. . .

 SHEETA
 Pazu -- look up.

 PAZU
 But. . .
 it was just rock. . .

 SHEETA
 It's pretty.

 POM
 Now, let's have a look.

 PAZU AND SHEETA
 Wow!

 SHEETA
 It went out.

 POM
 There are Levistone veins inside the rocks here.

 PAZU
 Levistone. . .?

 POM
 This happens when Levistone touches the air.
 It fades to become just like a rock. . .

 SHEETA
 It's glowing. . .

 POM
 I'm amazed!!
 That's a pure Levistone crystal. . .
 I'm beginning to see now. . .
 It's no wonder the stones are so restless. . .!!

 SHEETA
 There's a wonderful power in this stone.

 POM
 Only the people of Laputa had the power to make such a thing.

 SHEETA
 The people of Laputa. . .

 POM
 That was when it floated in the sky over Dekkai Island. . .

 PAZU
 There really was a Laputa, Sheeta!!
 It exists, after all.

 SHEETA
 Grandpa, where do you think the island is now?

 PAZU
 Grandpa Pom?

 POM
 S -- sorry, but could you put away that stone?
 It's too strong for me. . .

 SHEETA
 Y -- Yes!!

 PAZU
 What's the matter, Grandpa?

 POM
 My Grandpa told me. . .
 When the stones are noisy, it's because Laputa is over the mines.

 PAZU
 So. . .!
 If we go up into the sky now, we can see Laputa!!
 Sheeta, Father wasn't lying!!

 POM
 Little girl. . .
 That is. . .

 SHEETA
 Yes?

 POM
 I tell others about those stones because that's how I make a living,
 but the good luck the stones bring people
 also seems to invite bad luck. . .

 SHEETA
 Yes.

 POM
 There's more.
 That stone was made by human hands.
 Remember that. . .

 PAZU
 It's not like that!!
 That stone has saved Sheeta twice already, hasn't it!

 PAZU
 It's amazing!!
 Laputa is real.

 LOUIE
 They've gone.
 Let's go back to the ship, Mama. . .

 DORA
 Keep quiet.
 We shouldn't move for the time being.

 CHARLES
 I'm hungry. . .

 PAZU
 It's OK -- let's go.

 SHEETA
 Thanks, Grandpa.

 POM
 Be careful.

 PAZU
 Amazing clouds.
 Beyond the peaks of those clouds, where nothing can be seen,
 the island is floating.. .

 PAZU
 I'll do it!!
 I'll see Laputa for sure!

 SHEETA
 Pazu. . .

 PAZU
 Hm. . .?

 SHEETA
 There's something I still haven't told you. . .

 SHEETA
 There's an old, secret name in my family.
 When I inherited this stone, I inherited that name as well. . .
 My inherited name is Lusheeta. . .
 Lusheeta Toelle Ul Laputa. . .

 PAZU
 Laputa. . .
 Th -- that's. . .!
 It's the army!!
 Run, Sheeta!

 PAZU
 Run to the cave!!

 SOLDIER
 Don't move. . .

 PAZU
 What are you doing!?

 SHEETA
 Let me go. . . (chomp)

 DARK GLASSES
 Ah!!

 SHEETA
 Pazu!
 Pazu!
 Pazu!
 Pazu!

 SOLDIER
 We've picked them up.

 MOOSKA
 Gave you a lot of trouble, eh?

 PAZU
 Open up!
 Open up!

 PAZU
 Sheeta. . .

 GENERAL
 Too slow!!
 If we lock up a little girl like that, she'll talk at once!!

 MOOSKA
 That's a bad habit of the government.

 MOOSKA
 Hurry the matter, and both the girl and the investment will suffer,
 Your Excellency.

 GENERAL
 Hmph!!
 If we'd mobilized the troops in the first place,
 Dora wouldn't have stolen a march on us.

 MOOSKA
 Your Excellency, the elementary code is deciphered.

 GENERAL
 What!?

 MOOSKA
 This is work for my agents.
 Your Excellency must only move the troops at the right time.

 GENERAL
 Mooska!!
 I am the commander of the Laputa investigation.
 Don't forget!

 MOOSKA
 Of course.
 And I take secret orders from the government, don't forget.

 GENERAL
 Shit!
 Stupid NOVICE!!

 MOOSKA
 Did you sleep well?

 SHEETA
 Where's Pazu?!
 I want to see Pazu!!

 MOOSKA
 Don't you like fashionable clothes?
 Don't worry about him.
 His head is harder than mine.
 Look -- there's something I want you to see.
 Go in.

 SHEETA
 This. . .

 MOOSKA
 It has terrible destructive power.
 It's a robot soldier.

 MOOSKA
 If this fellow hadn't come falling out of the sky,
 nobody would have believed in Laputa. . .

 MOOSKA
 This wasn't made anywhere on the Earth's surface.
 It has power almost beyond imagining.
 And this body -- metallic?
 Ceramic?
 Our scientists still don't know for sure.

 MOOSKA
 Look at this. . .
 Don't be afraid.
 It's been inactive since we found it.
 Here.
 The same sign that was on the old fireplace in your home.
 And on this necklace, eh. . .?

 MOOSKA
 This stone won't work except in your hands.
 It will protect you
 until the day you want to return to Laputa.
 Then it will show you the way.

 SHEETA
 But, I don't know anything!!

 SHEETA
 If you want the stone, take it!!

 SHEETA
 Leave us alone. . .

 MOOSKA
 You think Laputa is kind of a "Treasure Island", don't you?
 Laputa flies because of a formerly impressive scientific power.
 It controlled the whole surface of the Earth
 in an empire of fear!!

 MOOSKA
 If it's still roving the sky,
 is it not a danger to peace?
 I think you understand.
 I'd like you to help me.
 Laputa's location is in the Levistone.
 You must know an incantation or something.

 SHEETA
 I really don't know. . .
 Let me see Pazu. . .

 MOOSKA
 I don't like to be violent,
 but that young man's fate is in your hands.
 If you help us, I'll set him free,
 Lusheeta Toelle Ul Laputa.

 SHEETA
 How do you know that . . .

 MOOSKA
 ``Ul'' means ``King'' in Laputan.
 ``Toelle'' is ``True''.
 You are the rightful successor of the Laputan royal family --
 Queen Lusheeta.

 PAZU
 Ouch. . .

 GUARD
 Come out.

 PAZU
 Sheeta!

 SHEETA
 Pazu -- are you hurt?

 PAZU
 I'm OK.
 But you!?
 They haven't done anything terrible to you, have they?!

 MOOSKA
 Pazu -- I was quite mistaken about you.
 Please forgive me.
 I didn't know that you were fighting to protect her from pirates.

 PAZU
 Sheeta -- what. . .

 SHEETA
 Pazu -- I beg you.
 Forget about Laputa.

 PAZU
 What!?

 MOOSKA
 The army will investigate Laputa in secret with Sheeta's help.
 I understand how you feel,
 but I'd like you to keep ``hands off'' for a while.''

 PAZU
 Sheeta -- is this true?
 But. . .

 SHEETA
 Forgive me for troubling you so many ways.
 Thank you.
 I'll never forget you, Pazu. . .

 PAZU
 It can't be -- Sheeta -- didn't you promise?

 SHEETA
 Goodbye.

 PAZU
 Sheeta!!
 Wait, Sheeta!!

 MOOSKA
 If you want to be a man, too, then listen to reason!!

 PAZU
 SHEETA!!

 MOOSKA
 This is small, but it's heartfelt.
 Take it and go.

 MOOSKA
 Please remember the words to make this stone work. . .
 If you keep your promise, you'll be set free, too. . .

 SHEETA
 Pazu. . .

 MADGE
 Shoo -- Shoo!
 Mama -- it's Pazu.
 Pazu came back!!

 OKAMI
 Pazu -- I've been worried.
 Nobody's seen you since yesterday.
 What happened to that little girl?

 PAZU
 She's all right.

 OKAMI
 Eh?!
 Pazu!!

 PAZU
 Let me go -- what are you doing!

 DORA
 Only staying for a bit, my boy.

 PAZU
 Get out!!
 This is my house!!

 DORA
 Big talk for a brat who can't even protect a little girl by himself. . .

 PAZU
 What?

 HENRI
 Look at how much money he's got!!

 DORA
 Oh, dear -- you sold the girl for money?

 PAZU
 You're wrong!!
 I wouldn't do a thing like that!!

 DORA
 I don't suppose you'll say how you got the money?

 PAZU
 Sheeta told me to take it!!
 So, I . . .

 DORA
 So you grew timid, and came back shamelessly?
 And you still call yourself a man!?!
 Eh??

 PAZU
 Don't brag!!
 Weren't you trying to get hold of Sheeta?!

 DORA
 Of course.
 Pirates try to get treasure, and where's the harm!!
 They're strange fellows.
 Why do they keep kidnapping the girl?

 DORA
 Do you think they'll let the girl live?
 Idiot!
 She was forced to settle with them to save you!

 CHARLES
 You understand well, don't you, Mama?

 DORA
 I haven't been a woman for 50 years for appearance's sake.

 DORA
 Don't you see?
 She saved your life.
 True love, just like my young heart.
 And you don't even shed a tear.
 All of you -- if you marry, find a nice girl like her.

 LOUIE
 You mean like you, Mama?

 DORA
 Good -- still using the old code. . .!
 They've summoned a warship.

 DORA
 They're leaving with the girl.
 If we don't hurry, we'll lose it!
 Move your asses!
 Let's go!

 PAZU
 Are you going to go kidnap Sheeta?

 HENRI
 The girl is nothing -- it's the Levistone!

 PAZU
 But, the Levistone is useless by itself !!
 If Sheeta doesn't hold that stone, it doesn't work!!

 PAZU
 Auntie -- won't you take me with you?!
 I want to save Sheeta.

 DORA
 If you go, you'll have to take care of yourself.

 PAZU
 I will.
 If I have the strength, I'll protect her.
 The treasure of Laputa is worth it!
 Please. . .

 LOUIE
 You're making her cry. . .

 DORA
 Shut up!!

 LOUIE
 Y -- yes. ..

 DORA
 We don't know if the girl will listen to us, do we?
 We can't go there twice.

 PAZU
 Understood.

 DORA
 You'll follow orders?

 PAZU
 Yes!

 DORA
 Don't take more than 40 seconds.

 PAZU
 All of you -- take care.

 DORA
 Fasten yourself onto me with this belt.
 You, wait on the ship.

 GENERAL
 An excellent ship.
 Mooska -- has the girl confessed?

 MOOSKA
 I need a little more time.

 GENERAL
 There'll be time enough in the air.
 We leave at down, with the girl.

 DORA
 Hurry up!
 It'll soon be light!

 GRANDMA
 Aw, that's too bad.
 Sheeta, I want to tell you something good.
 A spell for times of trouble.

 YOUNG SHEETA
 A spell?

 GRANDMA
 That's right.
 Very old, secret words.
 ``Leete Latobarita Uruth Ariaroth Bal Netoreel.

 YOUNG SHEETA
 Leete. . . La. . .?

 GRANDMA
 It's to save us.
 It is a wish -- ``Light, be reborn.
 Leete Latobarita Uruth Ariaroth Bal Netoreel.

 GENERAL
 An excellent ship.
 Mooska -- has the girl confessed?

 MOOSKA
 I need a little more time.

 GENERAL
 There'll be time enough in the air.
 We leave at down, with the girl.

 DORA
 Hurry up!
 It'll soon be light!

 GRANDMA
 Aw, that's too bad.
 Sheeta, I want to tell you something good.
 A spell for times of trouble.

 YOUNG SHEETA
 A spell?

 GRANDMA

 Leete. . . La. . .?

 GRANDMA
 It's to save us.
 It is a wish -- ``Light, be reborn.
 Leete Latobarita Uruth Ariaroth Bal Netoreel.

 SHEETA
 Leete Latobarita Uruth Ariaroth Bal Netoreel. . .

 SHEETA
 Ah?!!

 MOOSKA
 Excellent!!
 It was in an old manuscript -- this light is a holy light. . .

 SHEETA
 Holy light. . .?

 MOOSKA
 What kind of incantation is it?
 Tell me those words.

 GUARDS
 Hey?!

 GUARD
 It moved!!
 Yah!!
 The robot -- the robot's alive.
 Hello?!!

 GUARDS
 Save us!
 It's crazy!

 GUARDS
 It's moving.
 Put out the fire.
 It's the robot!!

 MOOSKA
 The robot! ?

 MOOSKA
 Where does it think it's going?! ?

 VOICE
 Hurry!!

 MOOSKA
 Amazing!!
 I see!!

 SHEETA
 Ah!!

 MOOSKA
 It's the light!!
 The seal on the robot was broken by the holy light.
 It has opened the way to Laputa!!
 Come here!!

 SHEETA
 NO!!

 MOOSKA
 It can fly?!

 DARK GLASSES
 It's crazy!!

 SHEETA
 It's piercing the sky. . .

 MOOSKA
 Laputa is in the same direction as that light.
 Hurry up!

 GENERAL
 Use the blasting powder?!
 Idiot -- do you want to blow up this fort?!

 GENERAL
 Hm!?
 Hello?
 Hello??
 Hey -- what's wrong!!

 DARK GLASSES 1
 Good.

 DARK GLASSES 2
 It's connected.

 MOOSKA
 This is Captain Mooska.
 Because of the robot, the communications circuits have been destroyed.
 Take emergency action.
 I'm temporarily taking command.

 MOOSKA
 The robot is trying to get to the girl on the East tower.
 Kill it the moment it's shown itself.
 Leave the fuses off the shells.
 Don't hurt the girl.

 GUARD
 Hurry!
 Hurry!

 SOLDIER
 Fire!

 VOICES
 We did it!
 Forward!
 Hurry!

 SOLDIER 1
 Ha, ha -- it's flattened.

 SOLDIER 2
 Amazing. . .

 SOLDIER 3
 Get the girl.

 SOLDIER 4
 Is she dead?

 SOLDIER 5
 Hey -- get up.

 SHEETA
 Ah. . .

 SOLDIER 6
 She's just fainted.
 Hey, stand up.

 SOLDIER
 It -- it moved. ..

 SOLDIERS
 Wah!
 Run!

 PAZU
 Ah!!

 DORA
 What's the matter -- looks just like a war.

 PAZU
 Let's go, Auntie!

 DORA
 Call me Captain!!
 Charles, fly a little lower.

 SHEETA
 Stop!!
 Stop, already!!

 SHEETA
 Please!!

 LOUIE
 Mama -- the Goliath is moving!

 DORA
 If they go, we'll end up flying right into their guns.

 PAZU
 There she is -- it's Sheeta.

 DORA
 What?
 Where?!

 PAZU
 Straight ahead!
 She's on the top of the small tower!!

 DORA
 The girl is brave!!
 You all, cover us!!

 PAZU
 Sheeta!!
 Sheeta, come on!!

 SHEETA
 Pazu!!

 PAZU
 Auntie, a little closer!!
 Wah!

 SHEETA
 Pazu!!
 Ah!!
 LET ME GO!

 PAZU
 Sheeta!!

 PAZU
 Auntie!!

 SHEETA
 Pazu!

 SHEETA
 Ah. . . PAZU!!

 PAZU
 Go up!!

 DORA
 It's our last chance.
 Grab her as we pass!!

 PAZU
 Yes.

 SHEETA
 Pazu!!

 PAZU
 Great!!

 DORA
 Go!!

 MOOSKA
 Get out of the way!!
 Damn!!

 PAZU
 Sheeta!!

 MOOSKA
 Shit.
 What is the Goliath doing?
 Ah!!

 MOOSKA
 A smoke screen. . .?

 GENERAL
 Mooska -- what happened to the robot?!

 MOOSKA
 The robot was destroyed.
 The girl has escaped.

 GENERAL
 What!?
 Look sharp -- put out the fires!!
 Form search parties!!

 MOOSKA
 Don't lose the holy light.

 MOOSKA
 Still showing the direction of Laputa. . .
 Inform the General,
 and we will depart for Laputa as planned.

 LOUIE
 Nice, isn't she. . .

 CHARLES
 Do you believe it. . .?
 That's the girl who's just like Mama.

 DORA
 Here's your valley.
 Glad to be rid of such a useless pair. . .

 PAZU
 Auntie, please let us ride on your ship.

 DORA
 Call me Captain!!
 You don't have the Levistone.
 Why should I let you on board?

 PAZU
 We'll repay you.

 SHEETA
 I certainly want to see the real Laputa with my own eyes.

 DORA
 Hmph.
 You're not greedy enough to ride a pirate ship. . .

 LOUIE
 Mama -- can she come along?

 DORA
 If there's any funny business, I'll throw you into the sea!!

 PAZU
 Yes!

 LOUIE
 We did it!
 A live-in cook.

 HENRI
 A dishwasher!!

 CHARLES
 A potato peeler!!

 ALL
 Yeah!
 Whew!

 CHARLES
 Can you make pudding?

 SHEETA
 Yes. . .

 LOUIE
 I like mincemeat pie!!

 HENRI
 And me. . .
 Well, now, let me see. . .
 I'll eat anything!!

 DORA
 Behave yourselves!
 Really!
 Still just children.

 DORA
 Careful!!

 PAZU
 It's canvas!!

 PAZU
 This ship is made of canvas!!

 DORA
 Don't damage it.

 PAZU
 WAH!

 LOUIE
 Don't loiter!!
 It's cramped.

 SHEETA
 Wah!!

 DORA
 Hurry up -- this way!!
 I hate shirkers!!

 LOUIE
 You -- this way.

 PAZU
 Wah!!

 SHEETA
 Pazu!!

 DORA
 He's fine.
 Come on!!

 LOUIE
 You aren't here to play!!

 PAZU
 It's an amazing engine.

 LOUIE
 Where'd he go?
 Uncle!
 Uncle!!
 Uncle -- hey, it's the assistant you wanted.

 ENGINEER
 Not so loud.
 I can hear you.

 LOUIE
 He's worse than Mama.
 Be careful.

 ENGINEER
 It's so cramped, my hand won't go in.

 PAZU
 It's this packing, isn't it. ..

 ENGINEER
 Your name?

 PAZU
 Pazu.

 DORA
 The Levistone pointed due east, didn't it?

 SHEETA
 >From the tower where I was, I could see the sun rise.
 Right now is the next mowing season. . .

 SHEETA
 so the sunrise is a little south of true east.
 The sun rose just to the left of the hills.
 The Levistone light crossed the lift tip of the sun's edge.

 DORA
 A good reply.
 How're things up there?

 RADIO OPERATOR
 Neither yea nor nay.

 DORA
 So, they're jamming the radio to hide their whereabouts, are they?!

 HENRI
 Mama, the Goliath's moving pretty fast!
 What'll we do?

 DORA
 We'll be on their windward side.
 If we use the trade winds. . .
 This is an Oriental calculator.
 
 DORA
 With wind speed 10. . .
 We'll do it somehow.
 Everybody, listen up!!
 We are setting course for Laputa.
 Our ship will now commence top-speed pursuit!!

 DORA
 Using the wind, we should be able to make contact tomorrow!!
 And I'll give 10 gold pieces to the first spotter!!

 CHARLES
 10 gold pieces. . .

 DORA
 Laputa is some sort of flying island.
 There's probably enough treasure for everybody.
 So!
 Everybody. . .
 GET TO WORK!!

 ENGINEER
 Now!!

 DORA
 Course 98. Velocity 40!!

 DORA
 There's nothing in that size!!
 Put this on!!

 DORA
 Here's your post.

 LOUIE
 Good!!

 DORA
 Full meals, twice a day.
 Economize on the water.

 MEN
 WAH!!

 DORA
 Fools!!
 Get back to work!!

 SHEETA
 Come in.
 Sorry, there's no dinner yet.

 LOUIE
 Heh, heh, heh. . .

 SHEETA
 It's my first airship kitchen. . .
 Do you want something?

 LOUIE
 Well . . .

 SHEETA
 Yes?

 LOUIE
 No, no -- I have some spare time, so I thought I'd be of some help. . .

 SHEETA
 Well, thank you.
 Would you do that washing?

 LOUIE
 Easy. . .
 Oop!

 LOUIE
 Hey, you said your back hurt. . .

 CHARLES
 I had some spare time and thought I'd help. . .

 MAN 1
 Out of the way.

 CHARLES
 Don't shirk. ..

 MAN 2
 Don't get in the way.

 MAN 3
 Shit -- what hurt your back?

 HENRI
 Hey -- can I be of some help. . .!?!

 ENGINEER
 So, you were scared too, eh?
 And they have the Goliath to help them. . .
 Pretty hopeless. . .

 DORA
 It's the island of Laputa, so it's no wonder.

 ENGINEER
 Heh, heh. . .
 Certainly they're good kids, those two.. .

 DORA
 What do you want me to say, you stupid old man?

 ENGINEER
 Nothing.
 But you should show more respect. . .

 DORA
 What!!

 ENGINEER
 No. . .
 Hey. . .
 Checkmate, isn't it?

 MEN
 It's good!
 Yum!
 Delicious.

 SHEETA
 Well. . .
 If anyone wants seconds. . .

 MAN
 Um. . .

 SHEETA
 Yes.

 VOICES
 Seconds!!
 Seconds!!
 Seconds!!

 LOUIE
 Hey!!
 Get up.
 It's arrival time.
 Take this with you -- it's cold!!

 PAZU
 The lookout. . .?

 LOUIE
 Yes . . .
 Phew -- cold!!
 You're up top.

 PAZU
 Yes.

 PAZU
 I'm second shift.

 LOOKOUT
 Thanks.

 PAZU
 Sheeta!!

 SHEETA
 Wow -- I was scared!!
 Wow!!

 SHEETA
 Pretty. . .

 PAZU
 Sheeta. . .
 Get in.

 DORA
 Can't sleep. . .

 SHEETA
 Yes. . .
 It's warm. . .

 PAZU
 Sheeta, look behind.

 SHEETA
 Yes . . .

 SHEETA
 Pazu. . .

 PAZU
 Hm?

 SHEETA
 I'm scared beyond words. . .
 The truth is, I don't want to go to Laputa at all.
 And I hope the Goliath beats us to it.

 PAZU
 What?!

 SHEETA
 Uh-huh. . .
 There are just too many strange and powerful. . .
 Well . . .

 PAZU
 You mean that incident with the robot. . .
 It was sad, wasn't it?

 SHEETA
 Yes. . .
 And it happened because of an incantation taught to me
 by my grandmother. . .
 I learned many other incantations, too.
 To find things, and to cure illness . . .
 And words I must absolutely never use.

 PAZU
 Words you must absolutely never use. . .?

 SHEETA
 Spells of destruction, spells of power. . .
 She said I must know the bad words, too, but never use them.

 SHEETA
 When I was taught, I couldn't sleep for fear. . .
 And it all had to do with the stone.
 It was always hidden in the fireplace,
 and except at weddings, never used. . .

 SHEETA
 Mother, and Grandmother, and Grandmother's Grandmother --
 everybody feared it!
 I wish it had never existed!

 PAZU
 You're wrong.
 Thanks to that stone, I met you.
 And thanks to that stone, Laputa won't be lost.
 All our progress with flying machines,
 and no one's seen it but my father.

 PAZU
 Yet, what'll we do if Laputa is really an island of terror?
 It must now fall into the hands of Mooska and the others. . .
 Besides. . .
 If we run away now, we'll be followed forever.

 SHEETA
 But, I don't want to make you a pirate for my sake. . .

 PAZU
 I won't become a pirate.

 PAZU
 Even Dora understands.
 I think she's really a good person. . .
 When this is all over, surely she'll take you back to Gondoa . . .
 I want to see it. . .
 The old house where Sheeta was born, and the yaks. . .

 SHEETA
 Oh, Pazu. . .

 PAZU
 What's that!!
 Underneath the ship -- hey, there!!

 PAZU
 It's the Goliath -- it's right below us!!

 DORA
 Hard to starboard!

 GENERAL
 Mooska -- why aren't we chasing them?
 They'll get away!

 MOOSKA
 It's no good, in the clouds.
 At any rate, they can't run far!

 MOOSKA
 We're on course and everything's going smoothly.

 DORA
 The course was more north.
 Pazu -- there's no time -- listen up!!
 If we don't shake off the Goliath, we're finished!
 You have good eyes; I want you to stay in the lookout.

 PAZU
 What should I do?

 DORA
 That lookout post will turn into a kite.
 There should be a handle inside.

 PAZU
 Found it!!

 DORA
 Turn it clockwise to hook up.
 Turn the upper handle to open the wings.

 DORA
 When it's open, don't stretch the wire.
 Remember, steer with your body!!

 DORA
 Is Sheeta up there?

 SHEETA
 Yes!!

 DORA
 You come back down!!

 SHEETA
 Why?

 DORA
 ``WHY''??''
 You're a little girl!!

 SHEETA
 Hey, Auntie, you're a girl, too!!
 Besides, I'm mountain-bred -- I have good eyes, too.

 SHEETA
 (Please!) Pazu thinks so, too!!

 DORA
 If you go up, don't use the voice tube.
 There's an internal telephone.

 SHEETA
 Is this the phone you were talking about, Auntie?

 CHARLES
 Wow. . .

 PAZU
 Yes -- we'll try.
 Let us up!!

 DORA
 Go!!

 SHEETA
 I can't see it. . .

 PAZU
 They've dived into the clouds.

 DORA
 Don't be careless.
 They may not be in front of us.

 PAZU
 Yes!!

 SHEETA
 Yah!!

 PAZU
 Hang on tight!!

 DORA
 What's wrong!!

 PAZU
 It's turbulence -- we're OK!!

 PAZU
 Just a little stirred up!!
 Yes!!
 I'll continue the watch.
 Scared?

 SHEETA
 Yes.

 PAZU
 I've gotten the hang of it now.
 It's a little stormy.
 Sheeta, get the string out of my bag.

 SHEETA
 Yes.

 PAZU
 Tie us together with it.. .

 SHEETA
 Sure!!

 LOUIE
 The barometer is falling rapidly, Mama. . .

 DORA
 Unlucky, eh?
 What a time to get stormy.
 How long until sunrise?

 CHARLES
 One hour!!

 PAZU
 Dawn. . .

 SHEETA
 Pazu, it's strange, the sunrise is coming from the side. . .

 PAZU
 I see!!
 We must be going north, not east!
 Bridge!!

 DORA
 Eh!?
 Go north, you say!?

 CHARLES
 The compass is pointing north!!

 DORA
 The wind has changed.
 We're off course!

 SHEETA
 Look -- there!!

 DORA
 What's the matter -- the Goliath?!

 PAZU
 The clouds.
 They're huge. . .

 DORA
 The clouds! ?

 SHEETA
 They're coming this way!!

 PAZU
 It's a sky castle. . .

 DORA
 THAT'S a low pressure center!!
 The ship won't stand the wind.
 Full power!
 Due north!

 PAZU
 It's coming closer!

 DORA
 All right!
 We're trying!

 PAZU
 WAH!!

 CHARLES
 The rudder won't move!!

 DORA
 Always the damn power -- what's the problem!!

 ENGINEER
 Dora -- the engine will burn up.

 DORA
 I don't want to hear any complaints!
 Just do it!!

 DORA
 Get out of the clouds!!

 PAZU
 Sheeta -- the ocean!!

 SHEETA
 Eh??

 DORA
 The Dragon's Nest!!

 PAZU
 The Dragon's Nest!?
 This. . .?

 PAZU
 The wind there is blowing in the wrong direction, just like Father said.

 DORA
 It's a wall of wind!

 CHARLES
 Mama, we can't get out!

 DORA
 We'll be sucked in.
 The wind just won't quit!

 PAZU
 Bridge!!
 Laputa is in there!!

 DORA
 What!?

 PAZU
 Father saw Laputa in the Dragon's Nest!!

 DORA
 You're crazy!!
 If we go in, we'll be shaken to pieces!!

 SHEETA
 Pazu -- there!!

 PAZU
 Ah!!

 DORA
 At a damn busy time like this!!

 PAZU
 Let's go, Auntie!!
 It's the way Father took, and he came back!

 DORA
 ALL RIGHT!!
 Into the Dragon's Nest!!

 PAZU
 Ah!!

 GENERAL
 Yeah, we did it!!

 MAN
 Our ship is in danger, too.
 We must retreat.

 MOOSKA
 No!
 Carry on.

 MAN
 Hunh?!

 MOOSKA
 The light always indicates the center of the whirling clouds.
 Laputa is inside the storm.
 Steady as she goes.
 There is certainly an entrance.

 PAZU
 Hang on, Sheeta!!

 SHEETA
 Yes!!

 PAZU
 (Father!)

 PAZU
 Sheeta. . . Sheeta!
 Are you OK?

 PAZU
 Look. . .

 SHEETA
 Laputa . . .?

 PAZU
 Yes.
 Oh -- sorry!!

 SHEETA
 Wait. . .
 Still pretty tightly knotted.
 My hands are shaking.. .

 PAZU
 We did it!!

 BOTH
 WAH!!
 Ha, ha, ha . . .

 PAZU
 There are birds. . .

 SHEETA
 What do you suppose happened to everyone. . .?

 PAZU
 It's coming to meet you, Sheeta. . .

 SHEETA
 But I don't have the Levistone . . .

 PAZU
 A knife will free us. . .

 PAZU
 What are you doing!!

 SHEETA
 Wait!
 Please, don't break that.
 Without that, we can't go back.

 SHEETA
 Ah!!

 SHEETA
 It's a Hitaki nest!!

 PAZU
 For this . . .! ?

 SHEETA
 Oh, good, the eggs aren't broken . . .

 PAZU
 Not afraid, are they. . .

 SHEETA
 Let's follow.

 PAZU
 Do you know the words?

 SHEETA
 Don't worry about that!

 PAZU
 Wow!!

 PAZU
 It's a city!!

 PAZU
 But we must be inside the buildings. . .
 Sheeta, the sky. . .

 SHEETA
 Yes. . .

 PAZU
 It looked like stone walls from the outside. . .
 But if their science was so advanced, why. . .?

 PAZU
 It's a tomb, isn't it. . .

 SHEETA
 Forgotten writing. . .
 Did you do this?

 PAZU
 It's not the same robot as before. . .

 PAZU

 PAZU
 It must be a gardening robot.
 There weren't any people.
 Who knows how long it's been standing guard here. . .

 SHEETA
 You offer flowers to offer before a tomb. . .?
 Thank you. . .

 PAZU
 You're all alone?
 Aren't there any other robots here?!

 PAZU
 Ha, ha. . .

 PAZU
 Doesn't look lonely at all, does it. . .

 SHEETA
 It has friends. . .
 Caring for even Hitaki nests, too.
 It won't die. . .

 PAZU
 This way!!

 PAZU
 The floor has crumbled.

 PAZU
 The Tiger Moth made it.

 SHEETA
 Auntie and the others are probably OK.

 PAZU
 Sheeta -- over there!!

 SHEETA
 Ah. . .
 Everyone is caught!!

 PAZU
 They've tied them up.

 SHEETA
 Can't we rescue them?!

 PAZU
 Let's go!!

 MAN
 We've opened a way into the city.
 Look at this -- there's a mountain of treasure inside!!

 GENERAL
 Phew. . .

 LOUIE
 Wow. ..

 GENERAL
 Do you like this?
 Want it?
 You'll all get enough -- rope that is!

 GENERAL
 Have you notified our country of the discovery of Laputa?

 MOOSKA
 I'll do it now.

 GENERAL
 Try to set up a difficult code.
 Hey -- no stealing!

 MOOSKA
 The fools are just blind enough.

 SHEETA
 Amazing tree roots. . .

 PAZU
 Sheeta, you can climb trees, huh?
 Let's go.

 PAZU
 They're doing terrible things. . .

 SHEETA
 If they go to the upper gardens. . .

 PAZU
 Sheeta, we've got to get back the Levistone.

 PAZU
 Only that will protect this place from those thieves.
 And why have the clouds cleared?

 PAZU
 If it hadn't been like this, they wouldn't have been able to land.

 SHEETA
 The effect of my spell. . .?

 PAZU
 Surely this is what Mooska said, about ``the seal being broken.

 PAZU
 This castle is awakened,
 because the holder of the Levistone approached,
 riding on the storm.
 If we don't act, Mooska will become King.
 And after the plunder, terrible things will start to happen.

 SHEETA
 But how should I get the Levistone back . . . ?
 The words . . .

 PAZU
 The words?
 Impossible. . .
 But. . .

 PAZU
 We'll go around from below.

 PAZU
 I'll jump first.

 SHEETA
 Yes. . .

 PAZU
 Ah!!

 MOOSKA
 It's around here.

 SHEETA
 Dear God. . .

 MOOSKA
 This is it!!

 DARK GLASSES
 Oh!!

 DARK GLASSES
 It's that brat!

 DARK GLASSES
 Oh!!

 PAZU
 Damn?!!

 MOOSKA
 Don't shoot!

 SHEETA
 Ah!!

 MOOSKA
 Well, well.
 A queen.

 PAZU
 Sheeta!
 Shit. . .

 SOLDIER
 Captain -- what's going on?

 MOOSKA
 The rest of the pirates.
 One more is hiding at your feet.

 SOLDIER
 Yes!
 Look for him!!

 PAZU
 Sheeta!!
 Wait. . .

 SHEETA
 Pazu!!

 SOLDIER
 Bring me a grenade.

 LOUIE
 It's Pazu and the others, huh. . .?

 VOICES
 What?
 Wow!

 DORA
 You're mistaken!!

 SOLDIER 1
 His Excellency!!

 SOLDIER 2
 What?

 SOLDIER 2
 Guards, fall in!!

 SOLDIER 2
 Hurry!!

 PAZU
 Auntie!!
 They've got Sheeta.
 I'm going to go rescue her.
 After I cut the ropes, get out of here.

 PAZU
 Run well away!

 DORA
 Hey, wait!!
 Take these.

 PAZU
 Thanks.

 DORA
 He's become a man, hasn't he. . .?

 GENERAL
 What!!
 Mooska broke up all the radios?

 SOLDIER
 Yes, sir.
 We caught his men making themselves scarce inside the ship.

 SOLDIER 1
 Many of the bridge crew are seriously wounded.
 Mooska is inside the lower hemisphere.
 The army witnessed it.

 GENERAL
 Greenhorn!
 Showing his true colors at last.
 Gather the troops.
 It's a spy hunt!

 SOLDIERS
 Gather all squadrons!!
 Hey -- Hurry up!!
 Number 3 squadron.

 SOLDIERS
 If they resist, I don't care if you shoot to kill.
 Find the entrance!

 DARK GLASSES
 Captain -- where in the world is this place. ..?

 MOOSKA
 The nerve center of Laputa.
 The castle and treasure above are just rubbish.

 MOOSKA
 The science of Laputa is completely stored in here.
 You will wait here.

 DARK GLASSES
 Captain!
 Wait, Captain!!

 MOOSKA
 Beyond here, none but the royal family can enter -- it's a sanctuary.
 What's this!!

 MOOSKA
 Tree roots, as deep as here. . .?
 (flip, flip)
 One paragraph, and it will all be reduced to ashes.
 Come -- this way.

 MOOSKA
 Shit -- here it is!!

 MOOSKA
 H -- here, too?!
 Shit!

 MOOSKA
 Found it!!
 Oh. . .
 Look at this huge Levistone!!
 THIS is the source of Laputa's power.

 MOOSKA
 Excellent.
 For 700 years it has been waiting for the return of the king.

 SHEETA
 700 years. . .?

 MOOSKA
 Your clan forgot about that, didn't it?

 MOOSKA
 It's the black stone!!
 Just like in the legend!!

 MOOSKA
 I can read it -- I can read it!!

 SHEETA
 Who in the world ARE you?

 MOOSKA
 I, too, have an old, secret name, Lusheeta.
 My name is Romooska Paro Ul Laputa.

 MOOSKA
 Your clan and my clan were originally one royal family.
 But when we went back to the earth, it divided into two. . .

 SOLDIER 1
 Not a crack.

 SOLDIER 2
 It's not just stone.

 GENERAL
 Use all the bombs we've got!!

 MOOSKA'S VOICE
 Your Excellency -- you cannot get in like that.

 GENERAL
 Mooska -- where are you?!

 VOICES
 Oh!!

 PAZU
 WAH---!

 MOOSKA'S VOICE
 Well!
 Why do you hesitate?
 Please come inside, Your Excellency.

 GENERAL
 Yes -- Follow me!!

 VOICE
 Follow His Excellency!!

 PAZU
 Oof!

 GENERAL
 Wh -- what is this place!!
 Mooska -- come out!!

 MOOSKA
 Be silent.

 GENERAL
 Wh -- what mockery is this?

 MOOSKA
 Be quiet.
 You are before the King of Laputa.

 GENERAL
 Are you mad. . . ?

 MOOSKA
 Today, we celebrate the rebirth of the monarchy.
 The rebirth of the World Empire under one King.
 Let me show you gentlemen the power of Laputa.

 PAZU
 Sheeta!!

 MOOSKA
 I will show you the threat of Laputa.

 PAZU AND SHEETA
 WAH!!

 VOICES
 Oh!
 Wah!

 MOOSKA
 It's the heavenly fire that destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah
 in the Old Testament.
 And the arrows of heaven which took Ramayana, Indora, and Atlantis.

 MOOSKA
 The whole world will bow to Laputa again!

 GENERAL
 Excellent, Mooska. . .
 You're a hero.
 Now here is your reward.

 MOOSKA
 Ha, ha, ha . . .

 MOOSKA
 Your stupid face made a perfect mask of disgust.
 Ow!!
 Oh -- you!!

 SHEETA
 Everyone -- run!!

 SHEETA
 Ah!

 MOOSKA
 Die!!

 MOOSKA
 Ha, ha, ha. . .

 SOLDIER
 Ah -- it's coming out!!

 DORA
 Those fools!!

 LOUIE
 It's full of them. . .

 DORA
 Everybody -- RUN!!

 LOUIE
 Y -- yes!

 DORA
 Check the flapters!!

 CHARLES
 Mama -- let's fly!!

 LOUIE
 Hurry, let's get away!!

 DORA
 Be quiet.
 Don't raise your voice.

 DORA
 Why are those two loitering behind!!
 They'll end up falling.

 MOOSKA
 I hope you don't anger me again.

 MOOSKA
 Because it looks like we'll be spending some time together.
 I hope they're not trying to get away.

 MOOSKA
 They really intend to fight me.

 PAZU
 A robot.

 PAZU
 Sheeta!!

 SHEETA
 Ah. . .

 MOOSKA
 Excellent!!
 Don't you think it's the best show?
 Oh!!
 Look!!
 The people are like garbage.

 MOOSKA
 What are you doing!!

 MOOSKA
 Shit . . .

 MOOSKA
 Give it back -- be a good girl.
 Come on.

 SHEETA
 Please -- open up!!

 MOOSKA
 Ha, ha, ha. . .
 Where do you think you're going, hm?

 SHEETA
 Open up!!

 PAZU'S VOICE
 Sheeta---

 SHEETA
 Pazu. . .!
 PAZU!!

 PAZU
 Sheeta . . .

 SHEETA
 Pazu!!

 PAZU
 Sheeta!!
 Sheeta!!
 Sheeta!!

 SHEETA
 Ah, Pazu!!

 PAZU
 I'm coming now.
 Shit. . .
 Get down!!

 SHEETA
 Hurry, take this!!
 It's Mooska -- hurry!!

 SHEETA
 Throw it in the ocean. . .

 PAZU
 Sheeta!!

 MOOSKA
 That stone you have is important.
 I'll trade the girl's life for it.

 MOOSKA
 Get up!!
 The game of tag is over.

 MOOSKA
 The old throne room is not very splendid, is it?
 Come here!!

 SHEETA
 You say this is the throne room?
 Then here is a grave.
 Yours and mine.

 SHEETA
 The country was destroyed and a King like you survived.
 What a joke!
 I won't give you the stone.
 You can't leave here without killing me.

 SHEETA
 Now, why was Laputa destroyed?
 I know perfectly well.
 There's a song in the valley of Gondoa:
 ``We need roots in the Earth;
 ``Let's live with the wind;
 ``With seeds, make fat the winter;
 ``With the birds, let's sing of spring.

 SHEETA
 No matter how many weapons you may have,
 or how many poor robots you use,
 you can't live separated from the ground.

 MOOSKA
 Laputa will not be destroyed.
 However many times, it will be reborn.

 MOOSKA
 The power of Laputa is the dream of the human race.
 Your ears will be next.
 On your knees!!
 Beg for your life!
 Get the stone back from the brat!!

 PAZU
 Wait!!
 The stone is hidden.
 If you shoot Sheeta, I won't return it.

 SHEETA
 Pazu -- don't come here, it's no use.
 He's going to kill us, no matter what.

 MOOSKA
 Brat -- the girl's life for the stone.
 Tell me where it is!
 Or are you just going to scare me with that cannon?

 PAZU
 I want to talk with Sheeta, alone.

 SHEETA
 It's no use -- throw away the stone and run!!

 MOOSKA
 I'll wait three minutes.

 SHEETA
 Pazu!!

 PAZU
 Sheeta -- calm down.
 Listen closely.
 Tell me those words.
 I'll say them, too.
 It's in my left hand.

 PAZU
 I've freed Auntie and the others.

 MOOSKA
 It's time!!
 Let's hear your answer.

 PAZU AND SHEETA
 Balse!!

 MOOSKA
 Ah. . .
 My eyes. . .
 My eyes!
 My eyes. . .
 My eyes. . .

 CHARLES
 Mama -- it's collapsing!!

 DORA
 It can't be helped -- launch!!
 Hurry!!

 HENRI
 Quickly!!

 HENRI
 Mama, look!!
 The bottom is falling off.

 LOUIE
 Sheeta was a good girl. . .

 DORA
 She used the word of destruction.
 Those children protected Laputa from the idiots.

 CHARLES
 The collapse has stopped!!

 LOUIE
 It's the Levistone!!
 What exceptional luck!

 MAN
 It's going up.

 DORA
 The tree!
 It may have them!
 Follow it.

 LOUIE
 That's crazy.

 PAZU
 Sheeta . . .

 SHEETA
 Pazu. . .
 Wow. . .

 PAZU
 The tree roots protected us.

 PAZU
 We'll break the wire.
 Let's go.

 SHEETA
 Yes.

 DORA
 What are you doing?
 We're supposed to be going up!

 HENRI
 We can't like this!

 LOUIE
 It's Sheeta!!

 VOICES
 It's Sheeta!!

 LOUIE
 They're alive.

 VOICE
 It's the apprentice.

 VOICES
 Hey!! Yoo-hoo!!

 SHEETA
 Auntie!!

 DORA
 Safely alive, aren't you.

 PAZU
 Everyone's OK!!

 ENGINEER
 Everyone's OK but my poor, tattered ship. . .

 DORA
 Don't be maudlin.
 We can build a pretty good ship!!
 Poor thing -- pretty cruel way to get a haircut. . .

 SHEETA
 Auntie -- ouch!

 DORA
 Oh, sorry.
 Isn't it pitiful?
 Worrying terribly, full of these.

 CHARLES
 At any rate, in our spare time. . .
 THE END

ORIGINAL AUTHOR'S NOTE: ``Okami'' means wife, but as it sounded pretty''
silly to have the woman being addressed as ``Wife'' all the time, I''
treated it as her given name instead. Thanks to JA/SFA, where I picked up
the handy word ``Levistone''. Beats ``fly-rocks''!
