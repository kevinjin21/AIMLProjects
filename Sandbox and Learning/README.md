# Sandbox and Learning
### Environment for testing new project ideas and learning new tools

This project folder was originally made to act as a landing zone for all AI learning and developed tools. Code stored here is not fit for production, and should be understood as such. Ideas from this folder may be used to create full projects in the future, so there may be redundancies in other code bases stemming from this one.

### Folder Hierarchy:
* Langchain and Ollama: Learning materials and mini-projects related to using LangChain and Ollama stack
* LLM Practice Projects: Mini-projects using tools and learnings from previous folder
