[Scene: In a small hat shop. Sophie works on a bunch of hats. Bessie enters the room.]
Bessie
Sophie?

I’ve closed up the shop. You should come too, Sophie.
Sophie
I’ll just finish this. Go have some fun.
Bessie
All right, then. I’m off.

I’m going.
Woman
Hey, wait!
[Action: Other women in the shop go to follow Bessie.]
Women
Isn’t this strange?

Look, it’s Howl’s castle.

What?!

Howl?

Where, where?

Look how close it is!
Bessie
Oh, no.
Woman
I wonder if Howl’s in town…
[Action: Sophie looks out the window. Howl’s castle walks into the distance, hidden away by clouds.]
Women
It took off.

No, it’s just hiding from all the soldiers.

Say, did you hear? Remember Martha from South Haven? They say Howl tore her heart out.

How scary…

Don’t worry, he’s not going to want yours.

Hahahaha!
Bessie
Hurry up!
Women
Hahahaha!

What? Really?

Hahahaha!

Oh, cut it out…
[Action: The women leave the shop. Sophie finishes the hat and prepares to head to town. She looks in the mirror and smiles before frowning and pulling her hat down.]
Sophie
Ngh…


[Scene: In the town. Sophie walks through alleyways on the way to Lettie’s bakery and is cornered by two soldiers.] 
Sophie
Ah… Mm…
Soldier 1
Hey there, little mouse. Lost your way?
Sophie
Oh no… I’m fine.
Soldier 1
Then how about a cup of tea?

Care to join me?
Sophie
No, thank you. I’m busy.
Soldier 2
She sure is cute for a little mouse.
Soldier 1
Say, how old are you? Do you live around here?
Sophie
Let me pass!
Soldier 1
See, it’s those whiskers of yours.
Soldier 2
She’s even cuter when she’s mad.
Howl
Hey there, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

I was searching for you.
[Action: Howl appears out of nowhere from behind Sophie and puts his hand on her shoulder.]
Soldier 1
Who are you?
Howl
I’m with her.

Why don’t you two take a little walk?
[Action: Howl waves his finger a few times. The soldiers are forced to move.]
Soldier 1
Ngh…
Soldier 2
Ah…
Soldiers
Hey…
Soldier 2
What the?
Soldier 1
Ah…
Soldier 2
Hey… Wait… Wait a sec…
[Action: The two soldiers march down the alleyway.]
Howl
Don’t hold it against them.
Sophie
Huh…?
Howl
They’re harmless.

Where to? I’ll be your escort.
Sophie
No, really. I’m only going to Cesari’s.
Howl
Act normally. I’m being followed. Just walk.
[Action: Howl leads Sophie down the alleyway. Dark purple humanoid blobs come out from the walls.]
Howl
Sorry, I got you involved.
Sophie
Ah!
[Action: Sophie clutches onto Howl’s arm. More humanoid blobs are coming out from the walls.]
Howl
This way.
[Action: Howl pulls Sophie around a corner. As they begin to walk faster, more humanoid blobs appear.]
Sophie
Ahh…!
Howl
Hold on!
[Action: Howl holds Sophie with an arm around her waist and jumps to bring them up into the air above the town.]
Howl
Drop your legs and keep walking.
[Action: Howl holds Sophie’s hands to keep her from falling. As Sophie extends her legs, the two walk together through the air.]
Sophie
Ah… Ah…
Howl
That’s right. Don’t be frightened.

Very nice.
Sophie
Mm…
[Action: Howl and Sophie arrive at the bakery and land on the balcony.]
Sophie
Ah…
Howl
I’ll draw them off. Wait here until the coast is clear.
Sophie
Yes.
Howl
That’s my girl.
[Action: Howl lets go of Sophie’s hand and jumps from the balcony. She runs to the edge but doesn’t see him below.]


[Scene: In the storefront area of the bakery. Lettie is handling customers.]
Lettie
Thank you.
Men
Any Lettie’s chocolate?

I’d like some, too.

Look this way, Lettie!

Hey, make room!

Let’s go for a walk, Lettie.
[Action: Another bakery worker runs to Lettie and whispers something.]
Lettie
My sister?
[Action: Lettie runs to the gate of the counter area and upstairs.]
Man
Come back soon, Lettie!
[Scene: Upstairs of the bakery. Sophie is standing near the windows leading to the balcony.]
Lettie
Sis?
Sophie
Lettie.
Lettie
How did you land on the veranda like that? Have you become an angel?
Sophie
It feels like I’m in a dream…
Salesman
Lettie, why not use the office?
Lettie
Thanks, but I should really be working.
Salesman
Okay.
[Scene: In a storage room. Sophie and Lettie are sitting on boxes of ingredients.]
Lettie
What? You sure he wasn’t a wizard?
Sophie
He was so kind…

He rescued me.
Lettie
Don’t tell me he’s stolen your heart.

If that was the wizard Howl, he’d have eaten it right up!
Sophie
Don’t worry, Howl’s only after beauties.
Lettie
There you go again.

Listen to me! We live in dangerous times. They say even the Witch of the Waste is back on the prowl.

Sis?
Sophie
Huh?
Lettie
Oh, you…
[Action: A baker pokes his head into the storage room.]
Baker
Lettie, the madeleines are done.
Lettie
Okay, be right there!
Baker
All right.
[Action: The baker leaves. Sophie stands up to leave as well.]
Sophie
I’m going home. It’s a relief to know you’re doing well.
[Action: Sophie and Lettie exit the shop.]
Worker
Hello, Lettie.
Lettie
Nice to see you.

Listen, are you going to spend your whole life in that shop?
Sophie
It meant so much to Papa. Besides, I’m the eldest.
Lettie
That’s not what I meant! Are you sure you want to be a hatter?
Sophie
Well, I… 
Worker
Bye, Lettie.
Lettie
Come by the shop next time!
Worker
Sure.
Sophie
I’ll be on my way.
Lettie
Sophie, you’ve got to look out for yourself.
Sophie
Sure.


[Scene: At night. Sophie returns to the shop. She enters and locks the door. After lighting a candle, the front door opens again. The Witch of the Waste stands at the entrance.]
Sophie
Sorry, the shop’s closed. I thought I’d locked the door.
[Action: The Witch of the Waste continues to walk through the shop.]
Witch
What a cheap shop full of cheap little hats.

And you’re quite cheap-looking yourself.
Sophie
This is just a simple hat shop.
[Action: Sophie walks to the door and opens it.]
Sophie
I think you had better leave.
Witch
You’re very brave, taking on the Witch of the Waste.
Sophie
The Witch of the Waste?

Ah!
[Action: The Witch of the Waste’s henchmen block Sophie’s exit. The Witch of the Waste flies toward Sophie and passes over her before reaching the exit.]
Sophie
Ah!
Witch
You won’t be able to tell anyone about that spell. My regards to Howl.
[Action: The door closes. The Witch of the Waste’s carriage runs off. Sophie has become an old woman. Upon seeing her hands, she begins shaking.]
Sophie
Mmm… Ahh…

Ahh… Hm?

Ahh… Ahh… Ah… Ahh…

Huh?
[Action: Sophie walks over to a mirror, where she sees her own aged face.]
Sophie
Ahh… Ahh… Is this really me?! I’ve got to stay calm.

Mm… Ahh… Mm…
[Action: Sophie paces around the shop and returns to the mirror, only to see that her face is still the same.]
Sophie
Ngh! I’ve got to calm down!
[Action: Sophie begins pacing around the shop again.]
Sophie
It’s no use panicking, Sophie.

I’ll be fine, I’ll be fine.

I’ve got to calm down. Oh, I’ve got to calm down…


[Scene: The next morning. Honey has come to visit.]
Honey
I’m back!
Woman
Welcome home, Ma’am!
[Action: Honey begins to show off an intricate hat.]
Honey
How do you like it? It’s all the rage in Kingsbury.
Women
Amazing!

It suits you.
Honey
Don’t you think it’s wonderful?

Sophie! Sophie!
[Action: Honey walks to the room where Sophie normally does her hat work, but Sophie is not there.]
Honey
Oh?
Woman
Ma’am, Sophie hasn’t come down to work yet.
Honey
I wonder what’s the matter?
[Action: Honey walks over to Sophie’s room in the living area of the building.]
Honey
Sophie!

Sophie!
[Action: Honey knocks on Sophie’s bedroom door.]
Honey
Sophie!
Sophie
Don’t come in. I’ve caught a bad cold. I don’t want you to catch it.
Honey
You sound just awful, like some 90-year-old woman.
Sophie
I’ll stay in bed today.
Honey
You sure? All right, then.
[Action: Sophie gets up from her bed.]
Sophie
Here we go…
[Action: Sophie looks at herself in the mirror.]
Sophie
You’ll be fine, old lady. You’re still healthy, and these clothes finally suit you.

But I can’t stay here.
[Action: Sophie exits her room with a shawl, hat, and small bag of provisions. As she walks, some of her joints pop.]
Sophie
Ah, ouch, ouch, ouch… It’s not easy being old.
[Action: Sophie exits the building through a back door into an alleyway.]
Man
They’re saying this war is going to be terrible…
[Action: Sophie walks through the town. As she passes over a pedestrian bridge over the railway, a train comes through, covering her with its smoke. She coughs as she reaches the end of the bridge.]
Man
Need a hand, granny?
Sophie
Such a gentleman, but I’ll manage.
[Action: Sophie talks to a pair of travellers.]
Man
Sure, old lady, but where are you off to?
Sophie
Just a bit further than where you’re going?


[Scene: At the base of the mountain. Sophie continues walking toward the Wastes.]
Man
I don’t recommend it, granny. Nothing but witches and wizards ahead!
Sophie
Thank you.
Woman
Going to the Folding Valley at this hour?
Man
She says her youngest sister’s there.
[Action: Sophie walks slowly up the hill. She stops for a break to eat and watches the town.]
Sophie
Haa… I’ve hardly made any progress at all.

Mm… Thank goodness I’ve still got my teeth.
[Action: Sophie notices a branch sticking out of a bush.]
Sophie
That’ll make a good cane. Up we go… Ow… Ahh…
[Action: Sophie makes her way over to the branch and tries pulling on it.]
Sophie
Might be a bit too thick.

Mm… Ugh… Grr…

Ouch, ouch…

Haa… What a stubborn branch.

Never underestimate Grandma Sophie!

Heave! Ngh…!
[Action: Sophie pulls on the branch with all her might. Eventually, the other end of the branch is freed from the bush, revealing a scarecrow with a turnip for a head. It stands on its own.]
Sophie
Ahh…!

A scarecrow, eh? I thought you were working for the Witch. But how do you stand by yourself?
[Action: Turnip is silent, and can only look at Sophie.]
Sophie
Your head’s a turnip.

I’ve always hated turnips. At least you’re not upside down anymore.

So long.
[Action: Sophie begins to walk off.]
Sophie
Ugh… It’s so cold. The town’s still so close.

Hm?
[Action: As Sophie looks back at the town, she sees Turnip hopping up the trail with a cane on its arm.]
Sophie
Don’t follow me! You don’t owe me a thing!

You must be a magical whatever-you-are! I’ve had enough of witches and spells!

Just go stand wherever you like!

Hmm?
[Action: Turnip makes its way up to Sophie. It drops the cane on the ground.]
Sophie
This is a perfect cane. Thank you kindly.

While you’re at it, could you bring me a house to sleep in?
[Action: Turnip hops off to find a place for Sophie.]
Sophie
Seems you get more cunning with age.
[Scene: Sophie makes it to the top of the hill. A battleship flies overhead.]
Sophie
What a huge battleship!

Ahh, I never realized how weak you feel when you get old.
[Action: Sophie sits down to take a rest again.]
Sophie
Hm? I smell smoke. Maybe there’s a cabin.
[Action: Sophie gets up again and starts walking.]
Sophie
Ngh… Okay… Okay… Okay…
[Action: As Sophie reaches the top of another hill, Howl’s castle comes walking into view. Turnip comes hopping alongside it.]
Sophie
Ah…

Turnip, isn’t that Howl’s Castle? This is hardly what I meant when I asked for shelter!
[Action: Howl’s castle begins to settle near Sophie and Turnip.]
Sophie
What is this? You call this a castle?
[Action: Howl’s castle gets up again and begins walking away. Turnip hops over to the castle’s entrance.]
Sophie
Is that the way in?
[Action: Sophie begins running over to the entrance as fast as she can.]
Sophie
Just wait up there! Ah!

Ah! Hey, there!

Are you going to let me on or not?!

Ahh!
[Action: The castle moves so that Sophie gets picked up at the entrance. Her shawl flies away, and Turnip hops after it.]
Sophie
My cloak!
[Action: Sophie opens the door. Before she can go inside, Turnip returns with her shawl.]
Sophie
It seems warm enough inside, Turnip. I’m going in. Thank you! Even Howl wouldn’t want an ancient heart like mine.

This time it’s really goodbye! You may be a turnip, but you’re a good turnip. May you find happiness!
[Action: Sophie enters the castle. She cautiously makes her way over to a chair by the fire and warms her hands for a little bit.]
Sophie
Phew…

Ow, ow, ow… Up we go…
[Action: Sophie throws more wood on the fire.]
Sophie
There we go…

What is this place? Just looks like a dilapidated heap.

Well, one nice thing about getting old is that nothing surprises you anymore.
[Action: As Sophie drifts off to sleep, Calcifer’s eyes appear in the fire.]
Sophie
Mmm…
Calcifer
That’s some spell you’re under.
Sophie
Hm?
Calcifer
It won’t be easy to break.
Sophie
The fire talked.
Calcifer
And you can’t even tell anyone about it.
Sophie
You’re Howl?
Calcifer
Wrong. I’m the fire demon, Calcifer!
Sophie
Well, then, Calcifer, can you break the spell I’m under?
Calcifer
Easy. If you break the spell that chains me to this place, I’ll break your spell in a flash.
Sophie
In other words, bargain with a demon. You sure you can keep that promise?
Calcifer
Demons don’t make promises.
Sophie
I suggest you look elsewhere.
Calcifer
But I’m an exploited demon! I’m chained here by a contract with Howl, who works me to death! I’m the one who keeps this castle moving!
Sophie
My, you’ve got it rough.
Calcifer
If you figure out the secret contract, the spell will break! If you do that, I’ll break your spell, too!
Sophie
All right. A bargain, eh?
[Action: Sophie drifts off to sleep.]
Calcifer
Granny… Granny!

Ngh… Tsk! I’ve got my doubts about her.


[Scene: The next day, in Porthaven. The mayor and a guard walk to a store with the name “The Great Wizard Jenkins” and knock. Sophie wakes up but doesn’t answer the door.]
Sophie
Ngh… Ahh…

Ugh…

Ow… Mmm…

Ah…
[Action: Markl comes downstairs to answer the door. Sophie pretends to be asleep.]
Markl
Hey, who’s this?
Calcifer
Porthaven!
Markl
When did she get in?
[Action: Markl grabs a cloak from a table and disguises himself as an old man.]
Markl
Stand by.
[Action: Markl turns the door handle and opens the door.]
Markl
Why, Mayor, sir.
Mayor
The sun is already high. Is Master Jenkins at home?
Markl
The Master is out.
Sophie
Ngh… Mmm… Ugh…
Markl
I answer in his stead.
Mayor
An invitation from His Majesty. It has come to war. His Majesty desires every wizard, magician, even the witches, to aid our homeland. His presence is imperative. That is all.
[Action: The door closes. Sophie gets up to throw more wood on Calcifer.]
Sophie
War, how awful.
Markl
And who might you be?
Sophie
Calcifer let me in.
Calcifer
Don’t look at me. She wandered in from the Wastes.
Markl
The Wastes? That’s strange…
[Action: Markl removes his disguise.]
Markl
You’re not a witch, are you?
Calcifer
A witch could never get in.
[Action: The doorbell rings.]
Calcifer
Porthaven, again.
Markl
A customer?
[Action: Markl puts his disguise on again.]
Markl
Stand by.
[Action: Markl opens the door.]
Markl
State your purpose.
Madge
Mama sent me.
Markl
The usual spell?
Madge
Yes.
Markl
Behave yourself, now.
[Action: Sophie walks over to the window. A beachside town is outside.]
Sophie
Huh…?

It’s not the Wastes.
Madge
Granny, are you a witch, too?
Sophie
Hm?

That’s right. I’m the scariest witch in the land!
Madge
Hehe…
Markl
Sprinkle this powder on your ship and the winds will favor it.
Madge
Sure.
Markl
Many thanks.
[Action: Madge leaves the building.]
Markl
I can’t have you making up things.
Sophie
You should give up that disguise.
Markl
It’s not a disguise. It’s magic.
[Action: Markl removes his disguise. The doorbell rings.]
Markl
Hm?
Calcifer
The Kingsbury door!
[Action: Markl puts his disguise on again.]
Markl
Stand by.
[Action: Markl turns the door handle again and opens the door.]
Messenger
Is this the residence of Wizard Pendragon?
Markl
It is, indeed.
Messenger
I bear an invitation from His Majesty. Please inform Master Pendragon that he is required at the Palace.
Markl
Our thanks to you.
[Action: The messenger leaves. Sophie walks out of the building to see the city again.]
Sophie
Wow…

A city fit for a king.
Markl
Get back in or you’ll lose your nose.
[Action: Sophie slowly returns to the inside of the building. Markl closes the door when she gets back inside.]
Markl
Stop wandering around!
[Action: Sophie turns the door handle.]
Sophie
Ngh… Urgh… There we go… Wow…
[Action: Sophie opens the door to a foggy plain. She closes the door.]
Sophie
Hehehe…
[Action: Sophie turns the door handle again and returns to Porthaven. She closes the door again and turns the handle.]
Sophie
Heh…
Markl
That’s enough! I’m going to get really mad!
Sophie
This is a magic house, isn’t it?
Markl
Oh, boy!
Sophie
Where does the black one lead?
Markl
Only Master Howl knows.
[Action: Markl goes to the pantry table. He picks up a plate of cheese and a loaf of bread.]
Markl
I’m having my breakfast.

Mm…
[Action: Sophie goes to the pantry table as well. She finds a plate of bacon and a basket of eggs.]
Sophie
But you’ve got bacon and eggs.
Markl
We can’t use the fire when Master Howl’s away.
Sophie
Fufufu… I’ll cook for you.
[Action: Sophie takes the basket of eggs and plate of bacon and goes to grab a frying pan. She takes it over to Calcifer’s space.]
Markl
But you can’t! Calcifer obeys only Master Howl.
Calcifer
That’s right. I won’t cook for you!
Sophie
Oh, here’s my hat. There we go…

All right, Calcifer. Be a good fire now.
Calcifer
Forget it. I’m a demon! I answer to no one!
Sophie
You’ll do as I say, or I’ll pour water on you. Or would you rather I told Howl about our bargain?
Calcifer
Ngh… Hey! Hey! I never should’ve let this old lady in!
[Action: Sophie pushes the frying pan toward Calcifer.]
Sophie
So what’ll it be?
Calcifer
Ngh… Urgh… Ahh… Ahh…!
[Action: Calcifer resists the pan, but eventually he gives up and becomes a manageable cooking flame.]
Sophie
That’s right, there’s a good fire.
[Action: Sophie lays down a slice of bacon in the pan.]
Calcifer
Hey! Hey! I’ll burn the bacon!
Markl
Calcifer’s doing what she says…
Sophie
I’d like some tea, too. Have you got a kettle?
Markl
Sure.

Umm…
[Action: As Markl looks for a kettle, the door handle turns.]
Markl
Hm?
[Action: Howl enters the castle from the black door.]
Markl
Welcome home, Master Howl.

You have letters from the king. To Jenkins and to Pendragon.
Sophie
Ah…
[Action: Howl walks over to Sophie and Calcifer slowly.]
Howl
Calcifer, you’re being so obedient.
Calcifer
She bullied me!
Howl
Not an easy thing to do.

Who exactly are you?
Sophie
Ah, I’m Grandma Sophie. You see, I’m your new cleaning lady.
Howl
Give me that.
Sophie
Ahh…
[Action: Howl gently pushes Sophie aside so that he has control over the pan.]
Howl
Pass me two more bacon slices and six more eggs.
Sophie
Ah… Eek…
[Action: Howl brings the pan in front of Sophie. She puts two bacon slices on the pan. Howl returns the pan to Calcifer. Sophie proceeds to pass Howl some eggs, which he cracks and cooks in the pan. As he cracks the eggs, he feeds the shells to Calcifer.]
Calcifer
Yummy… Yummy… Yummy… Yummy!
Howl
And who hired you to clean?
Sophie
Why, I hired myself. I’ve never seen such a filthy house.
Howl
Hmm… Markl, plates!
[Action: Howl takes the pan to the dining table.]
Calcifer
Ngh… You’re all ganging up on me!
Markl
Please join us, Sophie.
Calcifer
Ngh…

Ngh… Grr…
Markl
Sit over here.
[Action: Sophie sits down. Howl slides a plate toward her. Markl pours a cup of tea and holds out three utensils.]
Markl
Pick one.

Everything else is dirty.
[Action: Sophie takes a spoon.]
Sophie
I’ve got my work cut out for me.
[Action: Howl cuts some bread for Markl and Sophie.]
Howl
Markl?
Markl
Yes!
Howl
Sophie.
Sophie
Oh, thank you.
Howl
Brethren, let us partake of our daily bread.
Markl
Our daily bread!

Haven’t had a real breakfast in a long while.
[Action: Markl digs into his breakfast.]
Sophie
So many manners to teach…
Howl
So, what’s that in your pocket?
Sophie
Ahh… Huh?
[Action: Sophie feels around in her pocket. She finds a red card and pulls it out.]
Sophie
I wonder what it is…
Howl
Let me.
Sophie
Mm…
[Action: Sophie reaches across the table to hand Howl the card. Howl barely touches it when it reacts. The card falls, leaving a burn mark on the table.]
Markl
Ahh… It's scorched into the table! Master Howl, this is…!
Howl
Ancient sorcery. And powerful, too.
Markl
The Witch of the Waste?
Howl
“He who catches a falling star, oh heartless man, your heart shall be mine…”

Well, so much for the table.
[Action: Howl presses his hand over the scorch mark.]
Sophie
Ahh!
Markl
Wow…
[Action: The scorch mark disappears.]
Markl
Wow, it’s gone!
Howl
The scorch mark has vanished, but not the spell.

Brethren, continue your meal.
[Action: Howl gets up and gives his breakfast to Calcifer.]
Howl
Calcifer, move the castle 100 kilometers.
Calcifer
Yum, yum! Yum… Yummy…
Howl
And send hot water to the bath.
Calcifer
Huh? Not that, too!
[Action: Howl heads to the second floor.]
Markl
Do you work for the Witch of the Waste?
Sophie
Don’t be stupid! The witch… The witch…!
[Action: Sophie tries to speak, but her mouth closes on its own.]
Sophie
Actually… the witch… I… ngh… I… ngh… Ngh!
[Action: Sophie can’t finish her sentence. She jumps up and pounds her hands on the table.]
Sophie
Confound it!

Damn that Witch of the Waste! Wait till I get my hands on her! Let me finish eating this!
[Action: Sophie angrily continues eating.]


[Scene: Sometime later. Sophie starts cleaning the castle furiously.]
Sophie
Bugs, you’d better scurry away or I’ll sweep you out!

Every last one of you, mocking me…
[Action: Markl runs out of the house with some belongings.]
Man
There’s a spell I need.
Markl
Later. A witch rages within.
Calcifer
Sophie!

Sophie, I’m going out!

I’ll die without some fresh wood!

What? What are you doing?
[Action: Sophie grabs the wood that Calcifer is hanging onto with tongs.]
Calcifer
I’ll fall! I’ll fall! I’m in peril!
Sophie
I’m sweeping the ashes.
[Action: Sophie puts Calcifer’s log on a pot and begins sweeping the ashes away.]
Sophie
Won’t be a minute.
Calcifer
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Sophie
Mm…
Calcifer
Ahh! I’m in danger!

Ngh… Ahh… I’m in danger… I-I’ll go out… Ahh… Ugh…

Ah… Oh, no! Ngh… Ah… I-I’m slipping… I-I’m slipping… Urgh… Ahh…

Ah! I’m slipping! I’m in danger… Hurry, Sophie!
[Action: Calcifer’s log breaks, and he falls into the pot.]
Calcifer
Ahh… Ugh… Ah!
[Action: Howl takes the pot and puts some fresh logs out. He blows on Calcifer and brings him back to life.]
Sophie
Ahh…
Howl
Try not to torment my friend.
Markl
Master Howl, are you going out?
[Action: Howl closes the front door and changes its destination.]
Howl
Markl, tell our cleaning lady not to get too carried away.
[Action: Howl leaves through the door, and it goes back to Portshaven.]
Markl
What did you do, Sophie?
Sophie
Hm?
Calcifer
She abused me!

If I die, Howl goes with me!
[Action: Calcifer hides from Sophie as she walks past.]
Calcifer
Erk…
Sophie
II’m the cleaning lady! It’s my job to clean!
[Action: Markl runs to block Sophie from the second floor.]
Markl
N-N-No, not the second floor!
Sophie
If I were you, I’d put your precious things away in a hurry.
Markl
Ah! Save my room for later!
[Action: Markl runs upstairs to clean his room.]
Sophie
Fufufu… My little outburst gave me back my strength.

What a strange house.
[Action: Sophie enters the second floor bathroom to find an absolute mess.]
Sophie
Hmm?

Woah…

Hmm… Mm…
[Action: Sophie walks into the bathroom and opens the window.]
Sophie
Woah!

Amazing!

Calcifer, Calcifer! Are you moving this castle?
Calcifer
What a lot of fuss. Of course I am!
Sophie
You’re incredible, Calcifer! Your magic’s first class. I misjudged you completely!
Calcifer
You think so? You really think so!
[Action: Calcifer’s flame explodes to move the castle faster. Sophie goes back upstairs.]
Markl
Oh, no, n-not yet!
Sophie
Wow… Mm… Here we go…
[Action: Sophie opens a door leading to a balcony.]
Sophie
Ahh… Wow! Ah… Ah…
[Action: Markl joins Sophie on the balcony.]
Sophie
How beautiful.
Markl
It’s called Star Lake.

Hm?
Sophie
Hm?
[Action: Markl notices Turnip’s stick.]
Markl
Something’s stuck in there.
Sophie
Oh, dear. Lend me a hand, Markl.
Markl
Okay.
Sophie, Markl
There we go…
Sophie
There we go…
Markl
Ngh…
Sophie, Markl
Ngh…
Sophie
And up!
[Action: Sophie and Markl pull Turnip onto the balcony.]
Markl
It’s a scarecrow!
Sophie
He’s called Turnip, the turnip-head. You sure like being upside down.
[Action: Turnip jumps onto the side of the castle.]
Markl
Ah!
Sophie
The odd creature seems to have taken a liking to me. He followed me here.
Markl
Are you sure you’re not a witch, Sophie?
Sophie
That’s right, I’m the cleanest witch in the land!
[Action: Howl’s castle stops at the edge of the lake. Sophie and Markl take out the laundry. Turnip helps them.]
Markl
Turnip, don’t pull it so tight!
[Action: After doing the laundry, Sophie and Markl take a table out to have tea by the lake.]
Markl
Seems like he likes doing the wash.
Sophie
They’ll dry in no time.
Markl
Turnip must belong to the demons. Calcifer doesn’t seem to mind him.
Sophie
You’re right. Maybe he’s a demon of the dead.

But he led me to this wonderful place.
[Scene: Sometime later. Markl comes to get Sophie.]
Markl
I’ve put away all the laundry, Sophie.
Sophie
Why, thank you. We’d better be getting back.

How mysterious. I’ve never felt such peace.


[Scene: In the early morning hours. Howl returns to the castle from a night of fighting in the war. He sits on a chair in front of Calcifer’s fire.]
Howl
Phew…
Calcifer
It stinks. You reek of burnt flesh and steel.
[Action: Howl breathes heavily.]
Howl
Ngh! Ngh… Ugh… Ngh… Urgh…
[Action: Howl returns to his normal human form.]
Howl
Haa…
Calcifer
Keep flying and one day you won’t be able to change yourself back.
[Action: Calcifer takes a new log.]
Calcifer
Isn’t it great? Sophie did this for me.
Howl
The fighting is fierce. The country’s ablaze from the southern coast to the northern border.
Calcifer
I hate the fire in gunpowder. They have no manners.
Howl
My own kind attacked me.
Calcifer
The Witch of the Waste?
Howl
No, hack wizards masquerading as monsters.
Calcifer
They’ll cry plenty later on when they can’t regain human form.
Howl
No, they’ll just forget they ever knew how to cry.
Calcifer
Aren’t you supposed to report to the king yourself?
Howl
Yes, well… Send some hot water for my bath.
Calcifer
Huh? Not again…
[Action: Howl walks over to where Sophie is sleeping. He pulls the curtain back to see that  Sophie is her younger self again. She sleeps peacefully.]


[Scene: Later that morning. Howl draws a bath for himself, waking Sophie up. She is back to her old woman form.]
Sophie
Mm! Huh? Ah…

Is that Howl?
Calcifer
Yeah, wasting my hot water again.


[Scene: Sometime later. Sophie leaves the Porthaven shop with Markl.]
Markl
I’m sure Howl won’t eat any breakfast.
Sophie
No matter.
Man
Morning.
Sophie
Morning.

It’s lovely shopping in the morning. I’ve never seen the ocean.

Such beautiful sparkling water.
Markl
Same as it always is.
[Action: Sophie and Markl arrive at the shopping district. Sophie grabs some potatoes.]
Markl
I hate potatoes.
Sophie
Pay up.
Markl
Ugh…
Sophie
Thank you.
[Action: Markl pays the shopkeeper.]
Shopkeeper
Thanks!
[Action: Sophie looks at some fish.]
Shopkeeper
Fish, all fresh off the boat. That one’s tasty.
Markl
I hate fish.
[Action: A crowd of people runs toward the ocean.]
Men
The fleet’s come home!

They came home!
Sophie
Hm?
Man
Is that smoke?

There’s been another battle.
Shopkeeper
Really? Sorry, lady, later.
Crowd
That ship’s on fire!

Hey!
[Action: A smoking ship comes into the harbor.]
Crowd
Come on!

Come on!
[Action: Soldiers jump from the ship and into the water.]
Soldiers
Ahh!
Markl
Sophie, let’s go get a closer look.
Sophie
No, I’ve no stomach for such things. Let’s go home.
[Action: Sophie sees the Witch of the Waste’s henchmen some distance away.]
Man
Our most advanced battleship, reduced to this.
[Action: A henchman looks around. Sophie moves as close to the wall as possible.]
Sophie
Eek! Markl, there are Blob Men nearby.
Markl
Huh?
Sophie
Don’t move!

They work for the Witch of the Waste.
[Action: The henchman walks away.]
Sophie
They’re gone. Don’t people notice those terrible monsters?
[Action: Missiles drop from the sky and hit the water.]
Crowd
Ahh!

Look! Up there!

That’s what dropped those bombs!
Markl
An enemy airship, Sophie!
[Action: Sophie and Markl run through the crowd.]
Markl
Sophie, flyers! Sophie!
Man
Ignore the flyers! They’re enemy propaganda!
[Action: Sophie and Markl arrive back at the shop. Sophie breathes heavily.]
Markl
Are you okay, Sophie?
Sophie
Haa…

A glass of water, please.
Markl
Sure.
[Action: Sophie sits down in the chair in front of Calcifer.]
Sophie
Haa…
Howl
Ahhh!
Sophie
Huh?!
[Action: Howl comes running out from the bathroom, his hair now a red color.]
Howl
Ahh! Ahh… Ahhh…

Sophie! What did you do to the bathroom shelves?! Look!
[Action: Howl runs down the stairs and gets in Sophie’s space.]
Howl
My hair’s turned this weird color!
Sophie
Wh-What beautiful hair.
Howl
Take a good look! You mixed up everything on the shelves and ruined the spells!
Sophie
I didn’t mix up anything. I simply cleaned.
Howl
Cleaning, always cleaning… I told you not to get too carried away! It’s hopeless.
[Action: Howl sits down on the chair.]
Howl
How humiliating…
[Action: Howl begins to sob.]
Sophie
It’s not so bad.
[Action: Howl’s hair turns black.]
Sophie
This new shade’s quite lovely in its way.
Howl
I’m done for. What’s the point in living if you aren’t beautiful?
[Action: The shop’s walls begin to warp.]
Sophie
Huh? Ahh…

Huh? Huh? Ahh…
Calcifer
Stop, Howl! Cut it out!
Markl
He’s calling on the spirits of darkness. He did this last time a girl ditched him!
Sophie
Huh?

Please, Howl. That’s enough. You can just dye your hair again, right?
[Action: Sophie touches Howl’s shoulder, but he’s now covered in slime.]
Sophie
Eek!

Ahhh…

I’ve had enough of you, Howl! I’ve never once been beautiful!

I’ve had enough of this place!
[Action: Sophie exits the castle and into the rain. She walks to the edge of Star Lake and cries loudly.]
Sophie
Wahhh! Ahh! Wahh! Ahh… Ahh…
[Action: Turnip hops to Sophie and holds an umbrella.]
Sophie
Thank you, Turnip. You’re a kind scarecrow.
Markl
Please come back, Sophie! Howl’s in trouble!
[Action: Calcifer struggles to keep Howl’s slime away from him.]
Calcifer
Cut it out, Howl! I’m going out! Ahh… Ngh…
[Action: Sophie and Markl enter the castle.]
Calcifer
Sophie! Ngh… Get over here!
Sophie
My, he’s dramatic.
Markl
Is he dead?
Sophie
Don’t worry. A tantrum never killed anyone. Help me, Markl.
Markl
Okay.
[Action: Sophie and Markl push Howl’s chair toward the staircase.]
Sophie, Markl
Ngh… Ugh… Ngh… Ngh…
[Action: Markl runs upstairs while Sophie carries Howl.]
Sophie
Get that hot water running, Markl.
Markl
Okay!
Sophie
Come on, you can still walk.
[Action: Sophie turns to see Howl’s towel on the floor. She puts him in the bathroom.]
Sophie
You look after him now, Markl.
Markl
Sure!
Sophie
I’ll have to clean all over again…


[Scene: Sometime later, in Howl’s room. Howl lies in bed.]
Sophie
I’m coming in.
[Action: Sophie enters the room with a cup of milk.]
Sophie
Here’s some hot milk. Drink up.
[Action: Howl shakes his head.]
Sophie
I’ll leave it here. Drink it while it’s hot.
[Action: Sophie turns to leave.]
Howl
Don’t leave me, Sophie.
[Action: Sophie returns to Howl’s bedside.]
Sophie
Try a little milk?
[Action: Howl shakes his head. Sophie sits down. A mobile spins, and a bell rings.]
Howl
The Witch of the Waste is searching for my house.
Sophie
Huh? You’re right. I saw her cronies down at the port.
Howl
The truth is I’m a coward. All this junk is just sorcery to keep her away. I’m scared to death.
Sophie
Hey, why is the Witch of the Waste after you?
Howl
She seemed quite interesting, so I approached her. But she terrified me, and I ran away.
Sophie
Hmm…
Howl
Now the king has ordered me to report to him as Jenkins and as Pendragon.
Sophie
How many names do you use, Howl?
Howl
Enough to guarantee my freedom.
Sophie
Hmm… Can’t you refuse the king?
Howl
See that?
[Action: Howl points to a contract on the wall.]
Howl
It’s the oath I took at the sorcery academy.
Sophie
Say, Howl, why not visit the king?
Howl
What?!
Sophie
Just say it to his face. “Stop this foolish war. I refuse to help you!”
Howl
Haa… Sophie, you don’t know what they’re like.
Sophie
But he’s the king, right? A king thinks only of what’s best for his people.
Howl
I know!
[Action: Howl sits up in bed suddenly.]
Howl
You’ll go in my place, Sophie!
Sophie
Huh?
Howl
Pretend you’re Pendragon’s mother. Just tell him your son is an idle good-for-nothing! Maybe Madam Suliman will even give up on me!
Sophie
Madam Suliman?


[Scene: Sometime later. Sophie smashes her hat on her head.]
Howl
You’re wearing that hat?
[Action: Sophie takes a paper from Howl.]
Howl
After all the magic I spent making your dress pretty…
Sophie
Off I go.
Markl
Okay.
Calcifer
See you later!
[Action: Sophie heads to the door. Howl follows her.]
Sophie
Ah… Huh…?
[Action: Howl puts a ring on Sophie’s index finger.]
Howl
This charm assures your safe return.
Sophie
Huh?
Howl
Don’t worry. I’ll follow you in disguise. Now, off you go!
[Action: Howl opens the door. Sophie walks out to the streets of Kingsbury.]
Sophie
I’m sure this will never work.
[Action: Sophie walks through the streets, noting animals that Howl could be disguised as.]
Sophie
I don’t suppose he’s following me disguised as a crow.

I’m sure Howl would pick a more dramatic disguise.

Not that.
[Action: Sophie arrives at the palace grounds.]
Sophie
The palace is so far away.
[Action: Heen notices Sophie and begins following her.]
Heen
Huff…
[Action: Sophie notices Heen following her.]
Sophie
Howl? Don’t tell me you’re Howl.
Heen
Huff!
Sophie
Disguising yourself as an old dog, of all things. Do you know how exhausting it is to be old?
[Action: The Witch of the Waste’s carriage pulls up alongside Sophie.]
Witch
How nice to see you. The little hatter, right?
Sophie
The Witch of the Waste!
Witch
Thank you so much for delivering my note to Howl.

How’s Howl doing?
Sophie
Quite terrified. Thanks to him, I’ve become a cleaning lady.
Witch
Fufufu… My, how delightful.

By the way, what brings you to see the king?
Sophie
Job hunting. I’m sick of working for Howl. And yourself?
Witch
The king invited me. It seems that idiot Suliman finally needs my power.
Sophie
Why don’t you break the spell you put on me?
Witch
That’s impossible. My gifts lie in casting spells, not breaking them. See you later, then.
[Action: The Witch of the Waste’s henchmen carry her along.]
Sophie
Hey, wait a minute! Just wait!

If you weren’t here, I’d have hit her with my cane.
[Action: The Witch of the Waste’s henchmen pass the palace gates. A spell activates, and they begin to deflate.]
Witch
What’s wrong with you?
Guard
Madam, vehicles are prohibited beyond this point! Please continue on foot!
Witch
That Suliman… Using magic to force me to climb these stairs…
[Action: The Witch of the Waste inhales some smoke from a bottle and sneezes before getting out of the carriage. Sophie and Heen finally reach the gates.]
Heen
Huff! Huff, huff…
Sophie
We’ll catch up. Pay her no mind.
[Action: Sophie and Heen reach the stairs. The Witch of the Waste struggles to walk up. Sophie begins to walk.]
Sophie
Hup, hup, hup, hup…
[Action: Heen circles at the bottom of the stairs and puts his head down.]
Heen
Huff!
Sophie
Huh? Ugh…
[Action: Sophie walks back down and grabs Heen. She begins carrying him up the stairs.]
Sophie
Up we go… Hup… Hup… Hup…

Heavy! Why are you so heavy?
[Action: Sophie begins making her way past the Witch of the Waste.]
Sophie
Ngh… Urgh…
Witch
Ahh…
Sophie
Urgh… Ngh… Hup…
Witch
Ugh…

You… Hey… Wait!
Sophie
What is it? Suddenly remembered… how to break my spell?
Witch
I told you… I don’t know how.
Sophie
Then start studying up!
Witch
I don’t get it. Where does she get all that energy?
[Action: Sophie puts Heen down.]
Sophie
I have to put you down.
Witch
Ugh… Ugh… Ngh…
[Action: Sophie turns back to see the Witch of the Waste still struggling.]
Sophie
Why don’t you call it a day? You can’t make it.
Witch
It’s been fifty years now since they drove me out of here. I’ve been longing for this day… ever since.
Sophie
Good luck to you, then. Still, I’m not nice enough to help you out.

Come, Howl. Sheesh…
Witch
You heartless wench! Next time, I’ll turn you feeble, too.
[Action: Sophie struggles but finally makes it up to the top with Heen.]
Sophie
Up we go… Ugh… There we go…
[Action: Sophie puts Heen down.]
Sophie
Ngh… Haa…

Hurry up!
Guard
Madam, follow me.
Sophie
First, you should help her.
Guard
We are forbidden to assist anyone.
Sophie
But the king himself invited her.

Hang in there! Just a little farther!

And you call yourself a witch!
[Action: The Witch of the Waste reaches the top of the stairs.]
Witch
Who asked you? Haa…
Sophie
You suddenly look older.
[Action: Sophie, the Witch of the Waste, and Heen enter the palace.]
Guard
Madam Pendragon and the Witch of the Waste!
Witch
Haa…
Sophie
Pull yourself together. Isn’t this what you’ve been waiting for?
Witch
Ahh…
Guard
Madam Pendragon and the Witch of the Waste!
Witch
Pendragon… That name sounds familiar.
Sophie
Of course it does. That was the name of my hat shop.
Witch
It was?
Guard
Please wait here.
[Action: Sophie, the Witch of the Waste, and Heen enter a waiting room.]
Witch
Ahh… A chair! It’s mine! Ahh… Ahh…
[Action: The Witch of the Waste runs to a chair in the middle of the room and sits down.]
Witch
Haa… Mm…
Heen
Huff…
Witch
Ahh…
[Action: Heen runs to a hallway.]
Sophie
Howl, get back here!
[Action: Sophie walks to the hall, and an elevator door opens, revealing a young boy.]
Sophie
Hm?
Attendant
Madam, this way please.
[Action: A curtain opens.]
Witch
Haa… Hm?

Hmm? Huh?
[Action: A switch is flipped, and several bright lights around the Witch of the Waste turn on.]
Witch
Ngh! Ugh.. Ah…

Ahh… Ahh… Ahh… Ugh! Ahh… Ahhh…


[Scene: In Madam Suliman’s chambers. Sophie is guided to Madam Suliman.]
Suliman
I understand you’re Howl’s mother.
Sophie
Yes, my name is Pendragon.
Suliman
I’m sure you’re weary. Please have a seat.
Sophie
Yes.
[Action: Sophie takes a seat in front of Madam Suliman.]
Suliman
I am Madam Suliman, His Majesty’s witch.
Sophie
Hm?
[Action: Sophie notices Heen next to Madam Suliman.]
Heen
Huff…
Sophie
Um, that dog is…
Suliman
Oh, you mean Heen? He does my errands. I asked him to escort you.
Sophie
Ahh… Haa…
Suliman
Howl won’t join us, then?
Sophie
You see, he sends his mother to make excuses. I’m sure he’d be utterly useless to His Majesty.
Suliman
What a shame. He was my last apprentice…

He was a student of such marvelous gifts. I rejoiced in finally finding a worthwhile heir.

But then a demon stole his heart, and he abandoned me. He turned his magic to purely selfish uses.

Ms. Pendragon.
Sophie
Yes?
Suliman
That boy is dangerous. His power is too great for one with no heart.

If he follows that path, he’ll wind up like the Witch of the Waste. Bring her.
[Action: A boy brings the Witch of the Waste, who is now her true age as an old woman, into the room.]
Sophie
Huh?

What happened?
Suliman
I just restored her to her real age.
Sophie
Huh?
Suliman
All her powers are gone.
Sophie
Ahh…
Suliman
Once upon a time, she was a magnificent witch. She made a bargain with a demon who consumed her, body and soul, long, long ago.

Our kingdom can no longer afford to turn a blind eye to disreputable wizards and witches. If Howl comes here to serve the kingdom, I will teach him how to break with the demon. If not, I’ll strip him of his powers as I have taken hers.
[Action: Sophie stands up.]
Sophie
Now just a minute.
Heen
Huff!
Sophie
Now I understand why Howl refused to come here.

Something’s not right. Forcing your aged guests to climb stairs, dragging them into strange rooms… It’s like a trap!

You call Howl heartless! Yes, he’s selfish, cowardly, and unpredictable. But he’s straight as an arrow. He only wants to be free.

Howl won’t turn into an evil monster.
[Action: Sophie returns to her younger self.]
Sophie
He’ll battle the demon on his own. I believe in him!
Suliman
Ms. Pendragon… You’re in love with Howl.
[Action: Sophie returns to her older self.]
Sophie
Ngh…
[Action: The Witch of the Waste grabs onto Sophie.]
Witch
Howl… Howl’s coming? I want Howl’s heart. I want it!
Sophie
That’s enough from you. Howl’s not coming!
[Action: A flying machine flies overhead.]
Suliman
Howl will most certainly come.

Now, I’ve found his weakness.
[Action: Howl, in disguise as the king, arrives outside and enters the chambers.]
Suliman
Your Majesty.
King (Howl)
As you are.

How are you feeling?
Suliman
Thank you for asking.
King (Howl)
Meetings bore me. I flew out for a breather.
Suliman
How lovely.
King (Howl)
Who are these people?
Suliman
This is Wizard Howl’s mother.
King (Howl)
I see.
[Action: Howl walks up to Sophie. Sophie curtsies.]
King (Howl)
I appreciate it, but I don’t intend to win any war with magic.

It’s true that Suliman’s powers shield our palace from bombs, but they just fall on neighboring towns. That’s how magic works, right, Suliman?
Suliman
Such eloquence today, Your Majesty.
[Action: The real king arrives at the chambers.]
King
Suliman!
Sophie
Wha… Huh?
King
This is the final battle. This time, we’ll beat them to a pulp! Ah…
[Action: The king sees Howl disguised as himself.]
King
Hahahaha! Suliman, you’ve outdone yourself with that double. Await good news!
Suliman
Thank you kindly.
King
Have my generals assembled!
Guard
Yes, sir!
[Action: The real king leaves.]
Suliman
It’s been a while, Howl.
[Action: Howl bows to Madam Suliman.]
Howl
Delighted to see you doing so well.
Suliman
I saw right through you.
Howl
I’ve kept my oath.

I’ve no wish to fight you. I’ll take my mother.
Suliman
I won’t let you go.
[Action: Madam Suliman hits her staff on the floor. A wave appears and washes over Howl, Sophie, and the Witch of the Waste. The trio appear high above the ground.]
Witch
Ahhh! Ahhh!
Howl
Don’t look down. You’ll be dragged below.
Suliman
It’s time I showed your mother what you really are.
[Action: Shooting stars appear around Howl, Sophie, and the Witch of the Waste.]
Witch
Ahhh…!
[Action: Demons dance around Howl, Sophie, and the Witch of the Waste. Howl’s form begins to become more monstrous.]
Sophie
Ah…
Howl
Ahh… Ahhh!
[Action: Madam Suliman prepares to throw her staff.]
Howl
Ahhh…!
Sophie
Howl, don’t! It’s a trap!
[Action: Madam Suliman throws her staff. Howl carries Sophie and the Witch of the Waste up and out through the roof of the palace. They land on the flying machine.]
Sophie
Ouch…
Howl
Hold on tight!
[Action: Howl flies the machine into the air. Heen flies onto the Witch of the Waste’s lap.]
Sophie
Ngh… Ah…
Howl
Sophie, sit up front.

Oh, no, Sophie, you brought the whole gang along.
[Action: Sophie gets into the front seat.]
Witch
Nice doggie.
Heen
Huff!
Sophie
Hmph! You’re just Suliman’s spy. Oh well, too late to toss you now.
Howl
Sophie, you steer.
Sophie
What?! I can’t possibly!
Howl
They’re after us.
Sophie
Huh?
[Action: Several soldiers on other flying machines appear behind Howl, Sophie, the Witch of the Waste, and Heen.]
Howl
I’ll tackle them. Fly straight to the castle in the Wastes.
Sophie
What?! That’s impossible!
Howl
Don’t worry. The ring will guide you. Summon Calcifer with your heart.
Sophie
Summon Calcifer?
[Action: A small light appears from Sophie’s ring.]
Sophie
It’s glowing.
Howl
Follow the light. You’ll be there by nightfall.
Sophie
Why send me to Suliman if you were coming yourself?
Howl
Your presence gave me the courage for it. She’s too terrible to face on my own.

You saved me. I was in grave danger back there.
[Action: Howl lets go of the wheel.]
Sophie
Ahh! Don’t let go! Ahhh!
[Action: The machine begins to dive. Sophie spins the wheel frantically.]
Sophie
Urgh…
[Action: The machine hits the top of a building.]
Howl
You’re good.
Sophie
Stop joking!
Howl
We’ve got a lead now.

I can give you five minutes of invisibility. Now’s your chance.
[Action: Howl waves his arm and splits off from Sophie, the Witch of the Waste, and Heen.]
Sophie
Huh?! Howl!
[Action: Howl flies off.]
Sophie
Ah… Ah… Ahh!

Ngh!
[Action: Sophie pulls back on the controls, and the machine clips the top of a tree.]


[Scene: At the palace. An attendant takes out Madam Suliman’s staff from the chair.]
Attendant
Ngh…
Suliman
No, thank you.

Thank you. That’s the most fun I’ve had in ages. I suppose Howl thinks he’s escaped. Fufu… His mother’s awfully young.


[Scene: In Kingsbury and Porthaven. Soldiers surround Howl’s shops.]
Soldier
Ngh… Ngh… Ngh!
[Action: The soldiers break down the door in Kingsbury but find that there is only an empty lot. The soldiers also break down the door to the Porthaven shop.]
Soldier
Go!
[Action: Soldiers storm the shop, but there is no shop left.]


[Scene: At night, somewhere in the sky. Sophie continues to fly the ship, guided by Howl’s ring.]
Sophie
Hm?

We’re not far. That’s my hometown.
[Action: Heen comes out from under the Witch of the Waste’s coat.]
Heen
Huff!
Sophie
Don’t look so friendly. I don’t trust you.
[Action: Sophie flies past her hometown and into the Wastes. She sees the castle in the distance.]
Sophie
The castle! They’ve come to meet us!
Heen
Huff!
Markl
Sophie!
Sophie
Markl, help! I don’t know how to stop this thing!
[Action: The mouth of the castle opens and eats the flying machine. Sophie, the Witch of the Waste, and Heen crash through the first floor.]
Calcifer
Ahh… Ah! Ahh…
Markl
Ah…

Sophie!
[Action: Markl climbs over the rubble.]
Markl
Ah…
Witch
Doggie.
Heen
Huff!
Markl
Huh…?
Sophie
Markl!
Markl
Ah…
Sophie
I’m home!
Markl
Sophie, are you hurt?
Sophie
Woah…
[Action: Sophie slides down a pile of rubble.]
Markl
You’re home!
[Action: Sophie and Markl hug.]
Sophie
Thank you for coming to meet us.


[Scene: In a dream. The castle continues on. The Witch of the Waste sleeps with Heen. Sophie, back to her younger self, sleeps on a mattress on the floor. Howl, now in a more bird-like form, enters the castle.]
Calcifer
Ngh… Ugh…

Oh, no, you’ve gone too far…
[Action: Howl walks past Sophie. She wakes up.]
Sophie
Ah…

I wonder if Howl’s back.
[Action: Sophie sees a bloody bird footprint and a feather.]
Sophie
Ah…
[Action: Sophie grabs the feather, but it disintegrates.]
Sophie
Ah!
[Action: Sophie gets up and heads to the staircase. She sees more blood and feathers.]
Sophie
Ah…
[Action: Sophie goes upstairs to Howl’s room.]
Sophie
Howl?
[Action: Sophie enters Howl’s room. She walks through a cave of his belongings until she reaches a forked path.]
Sophie
Ah…
[Action: Howl breathes heavily. Sophie goes left until she finds Howl, who is now a monstrous bird.]
Sophie
Howl? Is that you?

Are you hurt? Are you in pain?
Howl
Stay away…
Sophie
I want to help you. I want to break the spell you’re under!
Howl
You can’t even break your own spell.
Sophie
But I love you!
Howl
It’s too late!
Sophie
Ahh!
[Action: Howl runs off. Sophie returns to her old self.]
Sophie
Howl!


[Scene: The next morning. Howl draws the baths. Sophie wakes up suddenly.]
Sophie
Ahh…

Haa…

Howl must be back.
Calcifer
Sophie, you better figure out how to break my spell quickly.

We’re both running out of time!
Sophie
Meaning Howl will turn into a monster? Is it true?
Calcifer
I can’t tell you that. I’m a demon.
[Action: Sophie walks up to Calcifer.]
Sophie
Calcifer, Suliman told me that Howl has given you something very precious. What is it? Where is it?
Calcifer
That’s confidential information.
Sophie
And if I threaten to dump water on you?
Calcifer
Ahh!

How dare you! Howl will die with me!
[Scene: Sometime later. Sophie walks outside. Turnip hops next to her.]
Sophie
Good morning, Turnip. We’ve got to be brave.


[Scene: Sometime later. Markl, Turnip, and Heen get ready to pull a rope attached to the flying machine.]
Markl
Ngh… Ready, Sophie!
Sophie
Okay! Open wider, Calcifer.

Here goes! Push!
[Action: Sophie pushes the flying machine as the boys pull.]
Markl
Heave! Ngh…
Sophie
Ngh…

I… said… move! Come on!
[Action: Sophie kicks the flying machine. It starts up.]
Sophie
Oh… Ahh…
[Action: The flying machine rumbles out of the castle.]
Sophie
Oh…
Markl
Ahhh!
[Action: The flying machine crashes to the ground and follows Markl, Turnip, and Heen.]
Markl
Ahhh!
[Action: The flying machine crashes into a rock and stops.]
Markl
Hahaha! Hahahaha!
[Action: Sophie begins sweeping out the castle.]
Sophie
They call it a castle, but once you get inside, it’s a junk heap.
Markl
Hahahaha! Hahahaha!
Sophie
It’s time to eat!


[Scene: Sometime later. Calcifer sulks as the Witch of the Waste watches him while Sophie feeds her.]
Calcifer
Urgh…

Mmm…
Sophie
Here, old girl.
Calcifer
But, Sophie, she’s the Witch of the Waste!
Sophie
No need to worry.
Calcifer
Why’s she staring at me?
Witch
Such a pretty fire.
Calcifer
Erk…
[Action: Howl comes running down the stairs.]
Sophie
Howl.
Howl
Hello, everyone!
Sophie
Welcome home.
Markl
Master Howl, can we keep this puppy?
Howl
An old witch and Madam Suliman’s dog… Why’d you let them in, Calcifer?
Calcifer
Don’t look at me! They blew in with Sophie!
Howl
Hahahaha!
Sophie
Hmph.
Howl
Sophie, always dramatic.
[Action: Howl goes to the hole in the castle.]
Howl
So you’re Turnip.
[Action: Turnip’s head spins around.]
Howl
Hmm… You’re under quite a spell, too.

Seems everyone in our little family is complicated.
Witch
He’s so handsome.
Howl
This is a busy day. We’re moving!
Sophie
Moving?
Markl
Oh, good. There aren’t any shops here in the middle of nowhere.
Howl
Madam Suliman can track us down here in no time.

But you’ll have to stay behind. The magic in your spell is too risky.


[Scene: Sometime later. Howl marks out a magic circle in paint on the ground outside. Markl throws a rock to the side.]
Markl
Mm…
Howl
All right, that’s done. Take it away, Calcifer!
[Action: Calcifer moves the castle into position. Howl draws a symbol on the floor of the castle.]
Howl
Excellent. Stay right where you are.
[Action: Howl picks up Calcifer on a shovel.]
Calcifer
Be gentle…
[Action: Howl walks back to the symbol.]
Howl
Here goes.
[Action: Howl raises his arm, and Calcifer flares to life.]
Calcifer
Urahh!
Sophie, Markl
Ah…
[Action: The house begins to warp.]
Sophie
Ah… Ah…
Markl
Ahh…

Ahh!
[Action: The house finishes its transformation.]
Sophie
Ah…
Markl
Ahh…
Sophie
Ah…
Markl
Ahh…!
Sophie
Hm?
Howl
We’ve moved. You can get up now.
Markl
Ahh!
Heen
Huff!
[Action: Markl begins running around the house.]
Markl
Amazing, Master! It’s so grand!
Witch
What a pretty fire.
[Action: Sophie runs to the window. She sees her hometown.]
Sophie
Ah… Ah…
[Action: A train passes.]
Sophie
This is…
Howl
I added a bathroom for our growing family.

Sophie, come here! Sophie!
[Action: Sophie goes to Howl.]
Howl
I added a bedroom, too. Go in.
[Action: Howl opens the door to Sophie’s bedroom, revealing her old bedroom in the hat shop.]
Sophie
Ah… Ah…
[Action: Sophie walks inside, instantly becoming younger but retaining her gray hair.]
Sophie
Ahh… Ah…

This is… Why?
Markl
Haha!
Howl
I thought it would suit you. Do you like it?
[Action: Sophie becomes a little older again.]
Sophie
Yes. It’s perfect for a housekeeper.
Howl
I got you new clothes, too. Open them later.
[Action: Howl runs off toward the entrance.]
Howl
Sophie! Come here! Quick!
[Action: Markl opens the door to the outside.]
Markl
A courtyard! Hahaha!
Howl
There’s a shop, too.
Markl
Let’s go, Heen!
Heen
Huff!
Howl
Sophie!

See that new color on the dial? There’s a new exit.
[Action: Howl turns the door handle and opens the door, revealing a large meadow.]
Sophie
Ah…
Howl
My gift to you, Sophie. Step outside.
[Action: Sophie walks outside.]
Sophie
Wow! Ah…
[Action: Howl guides Sophie through the fields.]
Howl
It’s my secret garden.
Sophie
It’s beautiful.

Did you make it with magic?
Howl
Only a little to help the flowers.
[Action: Sophie becomes younger again.]
Sophie
Wow! Ahh…

Thank you, Howl! It’s like I’m dreaming…
Howl
Sophie.
Sophie
How mysterious. I feel like I’ve been here before.

I could cry with happiness.
Howl
Come.
Sophie
Okay.
[Action: Sophie takes Howl’s hand. They make it to the top of a hill where they can see Howl’s cottage.]
Howl
Look.
Sophie
Wow!

What a sweet little house.
Howl
It’s my favorite hideaway.

When I was little, I spent my summers there alone.
Sophie
Alone?
Howl
My uncle, a wizard, left it to me in secret. Make yourself at home there, Sophie.
[Action: Howl walks toward the cottage, but Sophie doesn’t follow.]
Howl
What’s wrong?
Sophie
I’m scared. I’m afraid you’ll go off and disappear somewhere once I’m inside.

Howl, tell me the truth. I don’t mind if you’re a monster.
Howl
I want to make sure that you’ll all live comfortably. Why not a flower shop, with all these flowers?

How about it? You’ll be good at it, Sophie.
Sophie
And then you’ll go away?

I want to help you, Howl.

I’m not beautiful, and I’m only good at cleaning…
Howl
Sophie, you are beautiful!
[Action: Sophie becomes old again.]
Sophie
The good thing about being old is that you’ve got so little to lose.
Howl
Ngh…!
[Action: Howl looks toward the mountain. He sees a war plane.]
Howl
Why’s that flying here?
Sophie
A battleship?
Howl
On its way to burn cities and people.
Sophie
Is it the enemy’s? Ours?
Howl
What difference does it make?
[Action: Another war plane flies over the entrance to the meadow.]
Howl
Murderers…

Look at all those bombs.
[Action: Howl waves his arm and stops the plane’s movements with magic. His arm is transformed slightly.]
Sophie
It stopped. Did you do that?
Howl
I’m just tinkering. It won’t crash.
Sophie
Ah…
[Action: Sophie notices Howl’s arm.]
Sophie
Howl!
Howl
Oops, looks like they’re onto us.
Sophie
Huh?
[Action: Transformed wizards exit the war plane and charge toward Howl and Sophie.]
Howl
They’re Madam Suliman’s deputies. Let’s go back.
[Action: Howl grabs Sophie and begins to run.]
Sophie
Ahh…
Howl
Run! Move those legs!
Sophie
Ah… Ah… Ah…
[Action: Howl grows a pair of wings and begins to fly while carrying Sophie.]
Sophie
Ahhh!

Ah… Ah… Ah… Ah…

Ah… Ah… Ah… Ah…

Ah…!
Howl
Hurry on in!
Sophie
No! Don’t let go!
[Action: Howl lets Sophie go in the direction of the entrance to the castle.]
Sophie
Ah… Ahhh! Ahhh!
[Action: Sophie enters the entrance to the castle, landing on the staircase. Markl enters the castle again.]
Markl
Ah… What happened, Sophie?
Sophie
Ow, ow, ow… Ugh, I’ve had it with this place!


[Scene: Later that night, in Sophie’s room. Sophie mends a shirt. Markl knocks on her door and opens it.]
Markl
Good night, Sophie.
Sophie
Good night.
[Action: Markl prepares to leave but stops.]
Markl
Don’t worry about Master Howl, Sophie. Sometimes he’s gone for days on end.
Sophie
Thank you, Markl.
[Scene: In the living room. Sophie tucks the Witch of the Waste into bed.]
Sophie
Need the toilet?
Witch
I’m fine.
Sophie
Good night.
[Action: Sophie turns to leave.]
Witch
You’re in love.

You’re sighing away like that.
Sophie
Haa…
[Action: Sophie returns to the Witch of the Waste and sits on her bed.]
Witch
I thought so.
Sophie
Were you ever in love?
Witch
Of course I was. I’m still in love.
Sophie
What?
Witch
Men… Why should we ever want them? But a young man’s heart is so delicious!
Sophie
Unbelievable.
Witch
And so adorable, too. Heh…
[Action: An air raid siren sounds.]
Sophie
Ah…

What is that?
Witch
An air raid siren.
Sophie
Air raid?
Witch
It’s not for here, but best not to go out tonight.

Suliman’s creatures are searching high and low for our house.

What a good fire, hiding us so well.


[Scene: The next morning. Many townsfolk are evacuating. Markl and Heen head outside the shop. Honey arrives in a car, and Heen hides behind Markl.]
Markl
Hm?
Heen
Huff…
[Action: Markl runs back to Sophie, who is just coming out of the house.]
Markl
Sophie, a stranger got in!
Sophie
Hm?
[Action: Honey appears in the courtyard.]
Sophie
Ah…
Honey
Ah!
Sophie
Mother…
Honey
Sophie!!
[Action: Honey runs to Sophie.]
Markl
Ahh!
Sophie
Ahh!
[Action: Honey hugs Sophie.]
Honey
Where have you been?! I searched for you everywhere! Oh, but look at how you’ve aged!
Sophie
Ahh…
Honey
It’s all my fault! Ahh!
[Action: Honey hugs Sophie again.]
Honey
I’m so sorry, Sophie! Oh…
Sophie
Mother…
Honey
I’m so sorry…
[Action: Sophie invites Honey inside. The Witch of the Waste sits in front of Calcifer’s fireplace.]
Honey
I barely recognize the house. Who is that?

Oh, your landlady.
[Action: Honey drops her sachet on the table.]
Honey
Oh, Sophie, I’ve got a new husband!
Sophie
Huh?
Honey
He’s such a wonderful man. And he’s rich, too! We can all live together again!

You’ll never have to clean again!
Sophie
But I’m happy here…
Honey
Really? Oops, I forgot. My car’s waiting. I’ve got to run.
[Action: Sophie and Honey leave the house.]
Honey
I’m so glad I found you again, Sophie. We’ll really catch up next time. In the meantime, you take care.
[Action: The Witch of the Waste runs to the table and grabs Honey’s sachet. She runs back to her seat.]
Heen
Huff, huff!
[Action: Heen hides under a chair. The Witch of the Waste opens the sachet and grabs the peeping bug.]
Witch
A peeping bug, huh? The oldest trick in the book, Suliman.

All yours, Cal.
[Action: The Witch of the Waste throws the peeping bug to Calcifer. It falls in his mouth.]
Calcifer
Ah… Ahh… Gahhh!
[Action: Calcifer becomes very weak. The Witch of the Waste digs through the sachet until she finds a cigar.]
Witch
Hm… Hm… Ahh!
[Scene: Outside the shop. Sophie sees Honey off.]
Sophie
May you find happiness, Mother.
Honey
Thank you. You, too, Sophie.
[Action: Honey leaves.]
Honey
I’ve done what I was told. Take me back to my husband.
Attendant
Yes. I’m sure Madam Suliman will be pleased.
Honey
Hmph… Forgive me, Sophie…
[Action: Sophie walks back to the storefront.]
Sophie
Look at all these people.

They’re all running away. The town will be empty.
Markl
Do you wish to run, too?
Sophie
Huh?
Markl
That’s what that lady spoke of.
Sophie
So she did. I’m glad we made up.
Markl
Don’t go, Sophie!
[Action: Markl clutches onto Sophie’s dress.]
Sophie
Ahh…
Markl
I love you, Sophie. Please stay!
Sophie
Ahh…
[Action: Sophie hugs Markl.]
Sophie
I love you, too, Markl. Don’t worry, I won’t go.
Markl
Really?
Sophie
Yeah.
Markl
Are we a family?
Sophie
Yes, we’re family.
Markl
Oh, good!
[Scene: In the house. The Witch of the Waste huffs her cigar.]
Witch
I’ll never let Suliman get a hold of Howl.
[Action: Heen smells the cigar smoke.]
Heen
Huff…


[Scene: Later that night. Sophie tries to stoke Calcifer, but he won’t revive. Markl reads a newspaper, and the Witch of the Waste continues to smoke her cigar.]
Markl
But the paper says we won.
Witch
Only fools swallow such lies.
Markl
Hmm…
Sophie
How strange. I can’t get Calcifer going.

Grandma, will you stop that? It has such an awful stink.
Witch
Don’t deny an old lady her pleasures.
Sophie
Open the window, Markl.
Markl
Okay.
[Action: Markl runs to the window. The Witch of the Waste takes a drag of her cigar.]
Witch
I wouldn’t open that window now.

In Calcifer’s present state, he can’t possibly keep them out.
[Action: Markl opens the window.]
Sophie
Markl!
[Action: A war plane drops bombs over the town, rattling the house.]
Sophie
Ah… Ahh… Ahh! Ah…
Markl
Ahh…
Sophie
Close it quickly!
[Action: Sophie closes the window. She and Markl run to the courtyard.]
Markl
Ahh…!
Sophie
Look after Grandma, Markl. I’ll check on the shop.
Markl
Okay!
[Action: Sophie, who is now young again, runs to the street. She turns to see Suliman’s henchmen.]
Sophie
How dare you. If you’ve energy to spare, put out the fires!
[Action: Sophie runs into the shop and bolts the door. As she runs to the back, Suliman’s henchmen break in. Sophie sees the war plane flying overhead.]
Sophie
Ah!
[Action: The plane drops bombs on the area. Howl, who is more bird-like than man, grabs onto a bomb.]
Sophie
Howl!
[Action: The bombs drop, sending debris toward Sophie.]
Sophie
Ahh!
[Action: The house shakes. Markl holds onto the Witch of the Waste.]
Witch
Dramatic as usual.
[Action: Sophie turns to see Howl, who is still holding onto the bomb.]
Sophie
Ah… Howl!
[Action: Sophie runs to Howl and hugs him.]
Howl
I’m sorry. I had too many enemies tonight.
Sophie
Howl… Oh, Howl…
[Action: Suliman’s henchmen enter the courtyard. Howl enters the house with Sophie. The henchmen are blasted away.]
Markl
Master Howl! Sophie!
Howl
Calcifer, be strong!
Calcifer
Ugh…
[Action: Calcifer coughs up Madam Suliman’s peeping bug.]
Calcifer
Ugh…
Howl
Madam, was that a gift from Suliman?
[Action: The Witch of the Waste blows smoke into Howl’s face.]
Calcifer
That granny fed me something nasty!
Witch
Why, if it isn’t Howl. I feel we need a nice long chat.
Howl
Likewise, Madam. But we’ve no time now.
Witch
How unlike you. You’re not running away.
[Action: The Witch of the Waste puts her cigar out on Howl’s hand.]
Howl
Until later, then.

Stay here, Sophie. Calcifer will protect you. I’ll see to things outside.
[Action: Howl heads to the door. Sophie runs after him and hugs him from behind.]
Sophie
Wait, Howl! Don’t go! Please stay!
Howl
Another round of bombs is coming. Even Calcifer can’t stop those.
Sophie
Let’s run away. Don’t fight!
Howl
I’m through with running away. I’ve finally found something I want to protect. It’s you.
Sophie
Huh?
[Action: Howl flies out the door.]
Sophie
Ah… Howl!
[Action: Sophie runs into the courtyard.]
Sophie
Ahh…
[Action: Howl flies into the night. Suliman’s Henchmen continue to infiltrate the courtyard.]
Sophie
Ngh!


[Scene: Sometime later. Suliman’s henchmen continue trying to get inside the house, but Sophie holds the door shut. She turns the handle until the castle is moved to the Wastes. She runs into the rain.]
Sophie
Ah…
[Action: Sophie sees the town on fire.]
Sophie
That’s our town.
[Action: The bombs continue to fall.]
Sophie
Ah… There’s Howl.
[Action: A plane explodes.]
Sophie
Ah!
Howl
Urahhh!
Sophie
Howl!
[Action: The plane crashes to the ground.]
Markl
Sophie!
[Action: Turnip appears.]
Markl
Turnip!
[Action: Sophie runs back to the house.]
Sophie
Markl, come inside!
Heen
Huff!
Markl
Huh?
[Action: Sophie explains her plan to Calcifer.]
Calcifer
Move? You’re nuts. There’s nothing there!
Sophie
No. As long as we stay here, Howl will keep fighting.
[Action: Sophie ties a hood over the Witch of the Waste.]
Sophie
He’s better off a coward. Grandma, get up.
Witch
Going for a stroll?
Calcifer
Ngh… Suliman will find us right away!
Sophie
She already has. At this rate, Howl will never make it back alive.
Markl
Sophie! The castle’s falling apart!
Heen
Huff!
Sophie
That’s all right, Markl. Take Grandma.
Markl
Sure!
[Action: Markl guides the Witch of the Waste. Sophie grabs Calcifer’s shovel.]
Sophie
You, too. Hop up now.
Calcifer
Err… I can’t! My contract says I can’t leave the fireplace!
Sophie
If you two can’t solve this, I’ll do it for you.
[Action: Sophie digs the shovel into the ashes.]
Calcifer
Ahh! Watch it!
[Action: Sophie takes Calcifer out of the fireplace.]
Calcifer
Cut it out! Cut it out! Stop!
Heen
Huff, huff!!
Calcifer
If I leave, the house will collapse!
Sophie
Fine!
[Action: Markl, the Witch of the Waste, and Heen leave the house.]
Markl
We’re out!
Calcifer
Ngh…
Sophie
Get far away.
Calcifer
I’d better go out last.

Even I don’t know what’ll happen! Err… Ah…
[Action: Sophie and Calcifer leave the house. The interior is sucked away, and the castle begins to crumble.]
Sophie
Ah…
Heen
Huff…
Calcifer
I told you it would collapse.

Oh, it’s raining!
[Action: A war plane appears overhead.]
Sophie
Ah…
Markl
Is that heading for town?
Sophie
Look after Grandma, Markl. Turnip, find us a way in.
[Action: Sophie, Calcifer, and Turnip return to the castle. Heen follows after them.]
Markl
Don’t worry, Grandma. I’ll take care of you.
Sophie
Markl, we can get in here!
[Action: Sophie, Calcifer, and Heen enter the castle. Turnip grabs onto the Witch of the Waste.]
Markl
Ah…
[Action: Markl, the Witch of the Waste, and Turnip to the castle.]
Calcifer
The roof’s leaking… I’ll go out…
Sophie
Wait here.
[Action: Sophie puts Calcifer back on the fireplace.]
Calcifer
Ngh… It’s wet here… Ah!
[Action: Sophie grabs some wooden planks.]
Sophie
Ngh!
Calcifer
Hurry…
[Action: Sophie tosses the wood on Calcifer.]
Sophie
Ngh…
Calcifer
It’s too damp!
Heen
Huff, huff… Huff…
[Action: Heen gets a stick for Calcifer. Sophie gets a stool.]
Calcifer
Ngh…
Heen
Huff!
Sophie
Bring Grandma here, Markl.
Markl
The castle’s empty.
Calcifer
I told you if we stayed put, Howl and I could’ve handled it.
[Action: Sophie puts another log on Calcifer.]
Sophie
Ngh…

Calcifer, please. You’re my last hope.

I want to go to Howl. Move the castle.
Calcifer
Huh?!
Sophie
I know you can do it. You’re so strong.
Calcifer
But there’s no chimney here…
[Action: A drop of rain hits the wood.]
Calcifer
Erk… And the wood’s damp…
Sophie
As the saying goes, the best blaze brightest in adversity.
Calcifer
I’ve heard that, but… you really think so?
Witch
You’re so pretty, Cal.
Markl
Sit here, Grandma.
Calcifer
Then give me something of yours, Sophie.
Sophie
Something of mine?
Calcifer
I can’t do it alone. How about your eyes?
Sophie
My eyes?

How about this?
[Action: Sophie grabs her braid. Calcifer snips it off.]
Sophie
Ah…
[Action: Calcifer eats Sophie’s braid and turns black.]
Calcifer
Mm… Ahh…
Sophie
Ah…
[Action: Calcifer flares to life.]
Sophie, Markl
Ahh!
Calcifer
Ngh… Urgh…
[Action: Calcifer begins lifting up the castle.]
Markl, Witch
Ahh…!
[Action: Part of the floor falls out.]
Sophie, Markl
Ah!
[Action: A small part of the castle begins to move toward the town. Turnip hops along on the ground.]
Sophie
Amazing, Calcifer! You’re the best!
Calcifer
Imagine what I could do with your eyes and your heart.
Witch
Heart? You have a heart?
[Action: The Witch of the Waste sees Howl’s heart on the shovel.]
Witch
Oh, my!
[Action: Sophie sees Howl among a group of Madam Suliman’s henchmen.]
Sophie
There’s Howl. He’s trapped.
[Action: A bolt of lightning strikes Howl.]
Sophie
Ah… Hurry, Calcifer!

Ah!
Calcifer
Don’t!
[Action: The Witch of the Waste grabs Calcifer’s shovel and takes him out of the fireplace.]
Sophie
Grandma!
Calcifer
Ahh!
Sophie
Stop it!
[Action: The Witch of the Waste grabs Calcifer with her hands.]
Witch
Howl’s heart!
Markl
Ah… Ahh!
[Action: Calcifer flares to life again. The castle begins to rock violently.]
Calcifer
Ahh!

Cut it out!
Witch
Ahh!
Markl
Ahhh!
[Action: The castle begins to fall off a cliff.]
Markl
Ahh!
Sophie
Ahh!
Witch
Ah!
[Action: Calcifer’s flame engulfs the Witch of the Waste.]
Sophie
Grandma!
Witch
It’s hot! It’s hot! Ahh!
Sophie
Let go!
[Action: Sophie grabs the Witch of the Waste’s hands.]
Sophie
You’ll die, Grandma!
Witch
No, it’s mine!
Sophie
Ahh… Ahh…
Witch
It’s hot! Hot! Hot!!
[Action: Sophie grabs a bucket of water and throws it on Calcifer and the Witch of the Waste.]
Markl
Ah…!
[Action: The castle splits in half.]
Sophie
Ah!
Sophie, Markl
Ahh!
Markl
Sophie!
Heen
Huff!
Sophie
Ahh!
[Action: Heen jumps onto Sophie’s half. The castle goes tumbling down the mountain.]
Markl
Sophie!!
Witch
She’s so mean… That’s mine… Ngh…


[Scene: At the bottom of a chasm. Sophie sits up. Heen comes out from a pile of rubble.]
Heen
Huff! Huff! Huff! Huff! Huff…
[Action: Heen walks over to Sophie.]
Heen
Huff! Huff, huff!
Sophie
Oh, no, Heen. Look what I’ve done. I poured water on Calcifer!
[Action: Sophie begins to cry.]
Sophie
What if I’ve killed Howl, too? Wahhh! Ahhh!
[Action: A light appears from Sophie’s ring and points to the rubble.]
Sophie
Ahhh! Ahhh… Ahhh…
Heen
Huff, huff!
[Action: The light from Sophie’s ring disappears.]
Heen
Huff! Huff, huff, huff, huff, huff!
Sophie
Ah…
[Action: Sophie sees her ring trembling.]
Sophie
Ah…

It’s moving… Is Howl alive? Show me where he is!
[Action: The light from Sophie’s ring appears again.]
Sophie
Ah…
[Action: Sophie gets up and runs to a piece of rubble.]
Heen
Huff! Huff, huff!
Sophie
Ngh…
Heen
Huff!
[Action: Sophie moves the rubble, revealing a doorway.]
Sophie
The castle door…
[Action: The light from Sophie’s ring points to the door.]
Sophie
Ah…
[Action: Sophie opens the door. A wind blows from within. The light from Sophie’s ring points inside. Sophie reaches into the inky blackness and walks in.]
Heen
Huff, huff, huff, huff…

Huff!
[Action: Heen jumps in after Sophie.]


[Scene: In Howl’s past. Sophie finds herself in Howl’s cottage. Her ring trembles weakly.]
Sophie
Ah…
[Action: Heen scratches at the door.]
Sophie
Heen…
Heen
Huff, huff!
[Action: Sophie exits the cottage. Shooting stars appear overhead and strike the ground.]
Heen
Huff…
Sophie
Ngh! Ah…
[Action: Sophie sees that her ring is disappearing.]
Sophie
Ah…
[Action: A shooting star falls to the ground near Howl, who is walking in the field some distance away.]
Sophie
Howl…

Ah… Ah…

Ah…
[Action: Sophie runs toward Howl.]
Heen
Huff!
Sophie
This must be Howl’s childhood!
[Action: Demons begin running along the ground near Sophie. One runs into the water and disappears.]
Sophie
Ah… Ah!
[Action: Sophie’s feet begin to sink in the mud. She stumbles backward.]
Sophie
Ah… Ahh! Ahh…
[Action: A bright shooting star appears overhead. Howl catches it.]
Sophie
Ah…!
[Action: Howl says something to the demon. Sophie’s ring begins to shake violently.]
Heen
Huff!

Huff!
[Action: Heen runs toward Sophie.]
Heen
Huff!
[Action: Howl swallows the demon and clutches his chest.]
Y.Howl
Ngh!
Sophie
Ah!
[Action: Howl removes Calcifer and his heart from his chest. Sophie’s ring shatters, and a hole opens up in the ground under her.]
Sophie
Ah… Ahh… Ah!

Ahh!

Howl! Calcifer!
[Action: Howl turns to Sophie.]
Y.Howl
Huh?
Sophie
I’m Sophie! Wait for me! I promise I’ll come back for you!

Wait for me in the future!
Heen
Huff!
[Action: Heen flies into the hole after Sophie. The hole closes. Sophie and Heen fly into the unknown.]
Heen
Huff, huff!
[Action: Sophie follows Heen.]
Heen
Huff.
[Action: Sophie begins to cry.]
Sophie
Mm…
Heen
Huff, huff!
Sophie
Mm… I’ll walk there. Heen, I’ll walk. I can’t stop crying.
[Action: Sophie and Heen exit the past and into the real world.]
Heen
Huff, huff!
Sophie
Ah…
[Action: The doorway disappears. Howl, now almost an inhuman mass of feathers, waits for Sophie. Sophie walks up to him.]
Sophie
Howl…
[Action: Sophie moves the feathers out of Howl’s face.]
Sophie
I’m sorry I took so long. You’ve been waiting all this time.
[Action: Sophie kisses Howl.]
Sophie
Take me to Calcifer.
Heen
Huff! Huff! Huff!
[Action: Howl flies Sophie and Heen to Calcifer.]


[Scene: Elsewhere on the mountain. The remnants of the castle lumber on, slowly beginning to fall apart. Sophie, Howl, and Heen arrive.]
Markl
Mm… Ah!
Heen
Huff!
[Action: Howl lands and collapses. His feathers fall off, leaving him lying on the ground.]
Markl
Is he dead?
Sophie
No, he’s fine.
[Action: Sophie turns to the Witch of the Waste. The Witch of the Waste tries to hide Howl’s heart.]
Witch
Mm… Ngh…
Sophie
Grandma?
Witch
Don’t look at me. I don’t have anything.
[Action: Sophie hugs the Witch of the Waste.]
Sophie
Please.

Grandma…
Witch
You want it that badly?
Sophie
Yes.
Witch
Oh, well. In that case, you’d better take good care of it.
Sophie
Yes.
Witch
There.
[Action: The Witch of the Waste gives Sophie Howl’s heart.]
Sophie
Thank you, Grandma.
[Action: Sophie kisses the Witch of the Waste and takes Howl’s heart back to his body.]
Sophie
Calcifer?
Calcifer
Sophie… I’m all worn out.
Sophie
If I give Howl’s heart back, will it kill you?
Calcifer
Probably not if you do it, Sophie.

After all, we both survived the water you dumped on me.
Sophie
I’d better try, then.

It’s all warm and fluttery like a little bird.
Calcifer
It’s still only a child’s heart.
Sophie
May Calcifer live a thousand years, and may Howl recover his heart…
[Action: Sophie puts Howl’s heart back in his chest. Calcifer appears from Howl’s chest.]
Markl
Ahh!
Witch
Ahh!
Calcifer
I’m alive! I’m free!
Markl, Witch
Ahh!
[Action: Calcifer flies off into the sky. Howl wakes up.]
Howl
Ngh… Ahh…
Markl
He moved! He’s alive!
[Action: The castle begins to collapse.]
Sophie, Markl
Ah… Ah!
[Action: The castle begins to fall over the side of the cliff.]
Sophie
Ah… Ah…
Markl
You broke Calcifer’s spell!
Sophie
What?
[Action: The castle falls over, and the group begins sliding down the mountain.]
Sophie, Markl, Witch
Ahh… Ahhh!

Ahh… Ahh!
[Action: Turnip jumps into the air and plants itself into the ground in front of the floor, slowing down the group but breaking its pole.]
Sophie
Turnip!
[Action: The group reaches the edge of the cliff. Turnip loses its traction, and the floor falls between a rock and the cliff.]
Sophie, Markl
Ahhh!
Heen
Huff!
[Action: Turnip’s body falls on the group.]
Sophie, Witch
Ahh…
Sophie
Turnip, are you okay?
Markl
Ah…
Sophie
I’ll get you a new stick right away!

Thank you, Turnip.
[Action: Sophie kisses Turnip. It begins to expand.]
Turnip
Ngh…
Sophie
Ah!
Sophie, Markl
Ahh…
Sophie
Ah…
[Action: Turnip turns into the prince. He bows.]
Prince
Thank you, Sophie.

I’m a prince from the next kingdom. A cruel spell turned me into a scarecrow.
Witch
A spell that only your beloved’s kiss could break!
Prince
Exactly. And if Sophie hadn’t saved me, I would have died.
Witch
My, you’re good looking!
[Action: Howl begins to stir.]
Howl
Ngh… What a racket. What’s the fuss?
[Action: Howl tries to sit up but can’t.]
Howl
Ngh! I feel terrible like I’m trapped under a stone.
Sophie
Oh, yes, a heart’s a heavy burden.
Howl
Oh, Sophie, your hair is just like starlight!

It’s so beautiful.
Sophie
I love you, Howl! How wonderful!
[Action: Sophie tackles Howl in a hug.]
Howl
Ouch!
Markl
Ahh…
[Action: The Witch of the Waste covers Markl’s eyes.]
Markl
Erk!
Witch
So now you see how Sophie feels.
Markl
Ngh…
Witch
You’d best go home and make them stop this war.
Prince
That’s exactly what I shall do.

When the war is over, I shall return. A fickle heart is the only constant in this world.
Witch
My, you have a way with words. I’ll wait for your return, then.
Heen
Huff! Huff, huff, huff!
[Action: Heen laughs and spins in a circle.]
Heen
Huff… Hehehe!
[Scene: In the palace. Madam Suliman sees Heen laughing in her crystal ball.]
Suliman
Why should you contact me now? What on earth have you been up to?
Heen
Huff, huff, huff…
[Action: Heen moves to show Sophie, Howl, the Witch of the Waste, and the prince.]
Suliman
A happy ending, I see. You two-timer.
Heen
Huff… Huff, huff!
[Action: Heen rejoins Sophie’s group, and the vision in the crystal ball disappears.]
Suliman
Haa… Well, there it is.

Bring the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence. Let’s put an end to this foolish war.
Attendant
Yes, ma’am!
[Scene: In the mountains. Calcifer returns.]
Markl
It’s Calcifer!
Howl
You didn’t have to come back.
[Action: Sophie holds out her hands. Calcifer appears in his fire sprite form.]
Calcifer
I really missed you all. Besides, it looks like rain…
Sophie
Thank you, Calcifer.
[Action: Sophie kisses Calcifer.]
Calcifer
Fufu… Fufufu…
[Scene: Sometime later. Howl rebuilds the castle. Sophie, Howl, Markl, the Witch of the Waste, and Heen fly off into the sky.]
