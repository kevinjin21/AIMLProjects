# Surgery Case in South Korea Time Series Prediction
### Use time series analysis to predict medical procedure cases in South Korea.

This project is a spin-off of the Capstone project (Predicting total pharmaceutical sales in Korea). While exploring features for the previous project, interesting trends could be seen in the features 'Number of Surgeries (Cases)', 'Total Treatment expenses (Thousand Won)' and 'Benefits Amount (Thousand Won)'. Following, the relationship between these features is explored.

Furthermore, due to the time-series nature of the data, I use auto-ARIMA to train a model and predict future surgery cases. One mini-project from the UCSD ML bootcamp uses ARIMA for time series prediction, and this project is thus an extension of that exercise using real-world data. The original mini-project can be found [here:](https://github.com/kevinjin21/mec-mini-projects/tree/master/mec-18.5.1-time-series-analysis-mini-project) 

### Project Overview:
<u>Problem:</u> Predict cases of South Korean surgeries using time-series analysis of existing medical data.
<br>Topics:
* EDA of health data statistics; analyze existing trends in time series data
* Use auto ARIMA to train and predict future cases
